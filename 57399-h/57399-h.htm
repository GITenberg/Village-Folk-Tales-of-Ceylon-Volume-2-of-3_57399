<p class="first">At a certain place in Lan&#805;k&#257;wa (Ceylon),
there was an extensive forest. In that forest there were elephants,
bears, leopards, wan&#774;dur&#257;s,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1439src" href="#xd27e1439" name="xd27e1439src">2</a> and many
other jungle animals.</p>
<p>At any time whatever, at the time when any animal springs for
seizing an animal that is its prey, it comes running near a rock that
is in an open place in the forest. Having arrived near the rock, the
animal that ran through fear goes bounding back after the animal that
is chasing it. Regarding that rock, it was the custom that it was
[known as] &ldquo;The Rock of the Part where there is
Tranquillity&rdquo; (<i lang=

<p>One day a Basket-mender for the purpose of cutting bamboos went into
this forest. While he was cutting bamboos a certain jackal went driving
a hare on the path. At the time when the hare arrived near this rock
the jackal began to run back, and the hare ran behind it.</p>
<p>The Basket-mender, having been looking at this, examined the place,
and having gone near the King who was ruling at that time, told him of
this circumstance. And the King, having thought that it is a good
victorious ground, went there, and having built a city makes it his
capital (<i lang="si-latn">r&#257;ja-dh&#257;niya</i>). For that city
he made the name Sen&#805;ka&#7693;agala [Nuwara&mdash;that is,
Kandy].</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there were a Gamar&#257;la and a
daughter of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s, it is said. Well then, for the
Gamar&#257;la they brought a Gama-mahag&#275;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1480src" href="#xd27e1480" name="xd27e1480src">1</a> The
Gama-mahag&#275;&rsquo;s daughter and that Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s
daughter stayed in one place. The Gamar&#257;la and the
Gama-mahag&#275; cook and eat separately; the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s
daughter and the Gama-mahag&#275;&rsquo;s daughter cook and eat
separately.</p>
<p>A King comes every day to the house in which are the two girls.
Afterwards, the Gama-mahag&#275;&rsquo;s daughter, having quarrelled
with the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughter, went to the Gama-mahag&#275;
and told tales: &ldquo;A King comes every day to the house we are
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman said, &ldquo;Daughter, you go to that house to-day
[and watch if he comes].&rdquo; Having said &ldquo;H&#257;&rdquo;
(Yes), that girl went.</p>
<p>Afterwards the girl came to the house in which was the Mahag&#275;.
After having come, she said, &ldquo;Mother, to-day also the King
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then that girl&rsquo;s mother, having cut her finger-nails<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1491src" href="#xd27e1491" name="xd27e1491src">2</a>
and given them into the hand of the girl, said, &ldquo;Daughter, take
these and place them upon the beam of the threshold.&rdquo; The girl,
having taken them and placed them on the beam of the threshold, came to
the Mahag&#275;&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>On the following day the girl did not go to the house of the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughter. That day, also, came the King. After he
came he placed his foot on the beam of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>threshold;
then the finger-nails pricked him. Immediately the King went to the
city on the back of the tusk elephant.</p>
<p>On the following day, when that [Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s] girl was
weeping and weeping under a tree because he did not come, while some
crows were swallowing and swallowing the fruits of the trees a crow
said, &ldquo;And&#333;! What is that Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughter
crying for?&rdquo; The other crow said, &ldquo;What is it to thee! Do
thou in silence quickly swallow two or three fruits off
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, it having become night, part of the crows went to the
nests; two still remained over in the tree. One of them said,
&ldquo;An&#275;! What is that Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughter crying
for?&rdquo; The other crow said, &ldquo;What is it to thee! Do thou in
silence swallow the fruits off that. All the crows went away;
mustn&rsquo;t we also go? It has become night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughter laments, &ldquo;A light was
falling and falling [into my life]; it is not there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crow said, &ldquo;Being without a light, what art thou lamenting
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl said, &ldquo;A King was coming and coming to our house. Our
stepmother having placed some finger-nails on the threshold, they
pricked the King&rsquo;s foot, and having gone to the city he does not
come now. On account of that I am lamenting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the crow said, &ldquo;What are you lamenting for on that
account! Having shot (with bow and arrow) a crow that is flying [in the
air] above, and extracted its fat, should you take it to the city in
which the King is, when you have rubbed it on the wound in the foot it
will heal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the girl, having shot a crow that was flying above, and
extracted its fat, and tied up a packet of it, and dressed in
men&rsquo;s clothes, went to the city, taking the fat.</p>
<p>The girl, having gone to the city, and gone to the palace in which
is the King, said, &ldquo;What will He give me to cure His
foot?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="n5.1src" href="#n5.1" name=
"n5.1src">3</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>The King replied, &ldquo;I will give a gold ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl rubbed the oil [on the wound], and after she drew out
the finger-nail the foot became well. After that the King gave the girl
the gold ring. The girl, taking it, came home.</p>
<p>The King, taking a sword, on the following day came on the back of
the tusk elephant to the house in which is the girl. The girl was
asleep. Then the King descended from the tusk elephant, and taking the
sword went to the place where the girl was. &ldquo;Get up, thou,&rdquo;
he said. The girl arose. Then the King prepared to cut her neck.</p>
<p>The girl, having made obeisance, said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cut me
with the sword; it was I who cured His foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How didst thou cure it?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to the city in which He was, and having rubbed fat [on
the wound] and drawn out the finger-nail, came back,&rdquo; the girl
said.</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;How didst thou go to my
palace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl replied, &ldquo;I went in men&rsquo;s clothes, and having
rubbed oil on the foot and drawn out the finger-nail, I came
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou drewest it out, where is now the gold ring I gave
thee?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the girl, saying, &ldquo;Here is the gold ring He gave
me,&rdquo; showed it to the King.</p>
<p>After that, placing the girl on the back of the tusk elephant, he
went to the palace in the city.</p>

<p>In <i>Indian Fairy Tales</i> (M. Stokes), p. 199, a Princess in the
disguise of a Y&#333;g&#299; cured a Prince who had married her, and
who had been poisoned by means of powdered glass laid on his bed. She
applied earth from the foot of a tree, mixed with cold water, and
rubbed this over him for three days and nights. When the Prince wished
to reward her, she asked for a ring and handkerchief that she gave him
on their wedding day. She afterwards informed him that it was she who
had cured him, but he would not believe her until she produced these

<h2 class="main">The Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s Girl</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain city there was a King, it is said. The
King sends letters into various countries to be explained. When they
were sent, no one could explain the things that were in the letters.
When he sent the letters, on the following day [the recipients] must
come near the King. When they come the King asks the meaning in the
letter; no one can tell it. Well then, he beheads the man.</p>
<p>Thus, in that manner he sent letters to seven cities. From the seven
cities seven men came to hand over the letters. He beheaded the seven
persons.</p>
<p>On the eighth day a letter came to the Gamar&#257;la. There is a
girl of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s. When they brought the letter the
girl was not at home; she went to the village to pound paddy. Pounding
the paddy and taking the rice, when the girl is coming home the
Gamar&#257;la is weeping and weeping.</p>
<p>So the girl asked, &ldquo;What is it, father, you are crying
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la says, &ldquo;Daughter, why shouldn&rsquo;t I
cry? The King who beheaded seven men of seven cities has to-day sent a
letter to me also. Now then, the letter which the people of seven
cities were unable to explain, how can I explain? Well then,
mustn&rsquo;t I take the letter to-morrow? It is I who must take the
letter. When I have gone he will behead me. Well then, owing to your
being [left] without anyone, indeed, I am weeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl said, &ldquo;Where is it, for me to look at, that
letter?&rdquo; Asking for it, and having explained all the things that
were in the letter, she said to the Gamar&#257;la, &ldquo;Father,
having gone to-morrow, to what the King asks say thus and thus.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la on the following day went and handed over the
letter. The King, in the very way in which he asked those seven
persons, brought up the Gamar&#257;la, and asked him. The Gamar&#257;la
replied in the very way the girl said. Then the King asked the
Gamar&#257;la, &ldquo;Who expounded this?&rdquo; The Gamar&#257;la
said, &ldquo;There is a daughter of mine; that daughter herself
explained it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King said, &ldquo;To-morrow we are coming for the
marriage [to your daughter]. You go now, and having built inner sheds
and outer sheds, and milked milk from oxen, and caused it to curdle,
and expressed oil from sand, place them [ready]; those [previously]
unperformed matters,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>When the Gamar&#257;la is coming home the girl is not at home.
Having gone to pound paddy, and having pounded the paddy, when she
comes, taking the rice, that day, also, the Gamar&#257;la, weeping and
weeping, is digging some holes for posts.</p>
<p>So the girl asked, &ldquo;What, father, are you crying for to-day
also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Daughter, the King is
coming to-morrow to summon you in marriage, and return. Owing to it,
the King said to me, &lsquo;Having built inner sheds and outer sheds,
having milked milk from oxen and caused it to curdle, and having
expressed oil from sand, place them [ready].&rsquo; Now, then, how
shall I do those things? It is through being unable that I am
weeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl says, &ldquo;Father, no matter for that. Simply stay
[here]. Please build the [usual] sorts of inner sheds and outer sheds.
How are you to milk milk from oxen and curdle it? How are you to
express oil from sand?&rdquo; Afterwards the Gamar&#257;la indeed built
the inner sheds and outer sheds.</p>
<p>On the very day on which the King said he is coming, the girl, with
another girl, taking a bundle of cloth, went along the road to meet the
King. On the road there is a sesame chena. By the chena they met the
King.</p>
<p>When coming very far away, the Ministers said at the hand of the
King, &ldquo;That one coming in front is the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>daughter herself.&rdquo; The Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s
daughter, too, did go in front.</p>
<p>Then the King asked at the hand of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s
daughter, &ldquo;Where, girl, art thou going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughter replied, &ldquo;We are going
[because] our father has become of age [in the same manner as women].
On account of it [we are going] to the washermen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;How, girl, are men [affected like
women]?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl said, &ldquo;So, indeed! You, Sir, told our father
that having built inner sheds and outer sheds, having milked milk from
oxen, and caused it to curdle, and having expressed oil from sand, [he
is] to place them [ready]. How can these be [possible]? In that way,
indeed, is the becoming of age by males [in the same manner as
women].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King, having become pleased with the girl, asked yet a
word. He plucked a sesame flower, and taking it in his hand asked the
girl, &ldquo;Girl, in this sesame flower where is the oil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl asked, &ldquo;When your mother conceived where were
you. Sir?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1609src" href="#xd27e1609"
name="xd27e1609src">1</a></p>
<p>Immediately (<i lang="si-latn">&#275; p&#257;rama</i>) the King
descended from the horse&rsquo;s back; and placing the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s girl upon the horse, and the King also having got
on the horse, they went to the palace. The other girl came alone to
that girl&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>On the second day, the King having sent the Ministers and told the
Gamar&#257;la to come, marrying the girl to the King she remained
[there]. The Gamar&#257;la also stayed in that very palace.</p>

<h2 class="main">How Gourds were put in Small-Mouthed Pots</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain time a man cut a sesame chena. In the
sesame chena the sesame flowers blossomed. There was a female child of
the man&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The child one day having gone to the sesame chena, while she was
there the King came, in order to go near the sesame chena. Thereupon
the King asked at the hand of the girl, &ldquo;Girl, the flower that
has blossomed, where did it come from in the plant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl asked at the hand of the King, &ldquo;Before your
mother was married where were you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time, the King having become angry at the word which the
girl said, told the girl&rsquo;s father to come. After he came he said,
&ldquo;Because your girl said such a wicked word, come [to me after]
putting a hundred gourd fruits in a hundred [small-mouthed] copper
pots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, the man being afraid at this word went home, and remained
a dead dolt (<i lang="si-latn">mand&#257;</i>). Then the girl asked,
&ldquo;Why, father, are you without sense?&rdquo; Then the man told her
the word said by the King.</p>
<p>Having heard it, the girl said, &ldquo;Father, why are you
frightened at that? I will tell you a stratagem for that,&rdquo; and
told him to bring a hundred [small-mouthed] copper pots. After he
brought them, she told him to bring a hundred gourd-flower fruits (the
small fruit at the base of the flower). After he brought them, she told
him to put the hundred gourds into those hundred copper pots, and after
he put them in, the girl and the man went to the King, and handed them
over. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having given them, as they were coming away, the King said to the
girl, &ldquo;I will cause thee to be in widowhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl said, &ldquo;I will get a dirty cloth [set] on your
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King, after that man and girl went away, came and married her.
Having married her, and stayed a little time, in order to make her a
widow he went on a journey which delayed him six months.</p>
<p>Having waited until the time when he was going, what does this girl
do? Having made up her hair-knot on the top of her head, tying it
there, tying on a bosom necklace (<i lang="si-latn">m&#257;layak</i>)
like the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;s, she went to the sewing-shop.
Learning sewing for the whole of the six months, she sewed a good hat,
putting a dirty cloth at the bottom [inside it], and above it having
fastened [precious] stones; it was at the sewing-shop.</p>
<p>At that time, as that King, the six months having been spent, was
coming home through the middle of the street, he saw a costly hat in
the shop; and having given a thousand masuran, taking the hat and
placing it on his head, he went away.</p>
<p>Having gone, he said to the girl, &ldquo;I caused thee to be in
widowhood, didn&rsquo;t I? I said so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl said, &ldquo;On your head you got my dirty cloth,
didn&rsquo;t you? I said so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;You are not old enough<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1668src" href="#xd27e1668" name="xd27e1668src">1</a> to get your
dirty cloth on my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the girl said, &ldquo;Break up the hat and
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then when the King broke up the hat and looked the dirty cloth was
there. After that, having said, &ldquo;The two persons are equal to
each other,&rdquo; they remained in much trust [in each other].</p>

<h2 class="main">The Royal Prince and the Carpenter&rsquo;s Son</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there were a King and a Queen. In
the same city there were a Carpenter and his wife. There was a Prince
of the King&rsquo;s. There was a son of the Carpenter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They sent these two near a teacher to learn letters and sciences.
After a number of years, one day, in order to look at this
Prince&rsquo;s learning, the King, having gone near the teacher who
teaches the sciences, and made inquiry regarding the Prince&rsquo;s
lessons, [ascertained that] the King&rsquo;s Prince was not able to
[understand] any science; the Carpenter&rsquo;s son was conversant
(<i lang="si-latn">nipuna</i>) with all sciences.</p>
<p>Thereupon the King, having become grieved, went to the palace, and
said to the Queen, &ldquo;Thy Prince is a decided miserable
fool.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1714src" href="#xd27e1714" name=
"xd27e1714src">1</a> Because of it, I must behead the Prince,&rdquo;
the King settled.</p>
<p>Then the Queen said to the Prince, &ldquo;As you have not got any
learning he has settled to behead you. Because of it, leave this city,
and go somewhere or other.&rdquo; Having said [this], and, unknown to
the King, tied up and given the Prince a package of cooked rice, and
given him a horse and a sword and a thousand masuran, she sent him on
his journey.</p>
<p>This Prince and the Carpenter&rsquo;s son were very great
confidential friends. Because of it, the Prince, having said that he
must go [after] having spoken to his friend, went near his friend, and
said, &ldquo;Our father, because I am unable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>to
[understand] letters and sciences, has settled to behead me. Because of
it, I am going to another country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Carpenter&rsquo;s son said, &ldquo;If you, Sir, are
leaving this city and going away, I also must go to the place where you
are going.&rdquo; Having said [this], the Carpenter&rsquo;s son set out
to go with the Prince.</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;As for me, blame having fallen on me
from the King, I am going; there is no reason at all for you to
go.&rdquo; That word the Carpenter&rsquo;s son would not hear. Both of
them having mounted on the horse, entered the jungle, and began to go
away.</p>
<p>At the time when they had gone a number of gawuwas (each of four
miles), it became night; and having gone upon a high rock, and eaten
the packet of cooked rice that was brought, at the time when the two
persons were talking the Prince saw that a great light had fallen
somewhat far away. Having said, &ldquo;Friend, get up and look what is
that light,&rdquo; when that one arose and looked, a great
N&#257;gay&#257;, having ejected a stone, is eating food.</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;How is the way to take the stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Carpenter&rsquo;s son said, &ldquo;You go, and, taking the
stone, come back running, without having looked back. The Cobra will
come running; then I will cut it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I cannot; you go and bring it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereafter, the Carpenter&rsquo;s son having gone, at the time when
he was coming back [after] taking the stone, the Cobra came after him,
crying and crying out. The Prince, taking [the stone] and having
waited, cut it down. Instantly, both of them having mounted on the back
of the horse, began to run off.</p>
<p>Having gone very far, after they halted they looked at the stone. On
the stone was written, &ldquo;There is a well in this jungle. When one
has held the stone to the well, the water will dry up. Having descended
into the well, when one has looked there will be a palace; there will
also be a Princess in the palace. If there should be a person who has
obtained this stone, it is he himself whom this Princess will
marry.&rdquo; [This] was written upon the stone.</p>
<p>Thereafter, after it became light, these two persons began
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>to seek the well. At the time when they were
seeking and looking for it they met with the well. When they held the
stone to the well the water dried up. Both of them having descended
into the well, when they looked about, they met with the palace also;
the Princess, too, was there.</p>
<p>Thereupon the royal Prince said to the Carpenter&rsquo;s son,
&ldquo;Owing to your good luck we met with this gem-treasure<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1747src" href="#xd27e1747" name="xd27e1747src">2</a>
and the Princess. Because of that, let the Princess be for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Carpenter&rsquo;s son said to the Prince, &ldquo;You, Sir, are a
great fool. You are my royal Prince; it is not right to say this word
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereafter, having married the Princess to the Prince, and united
the two persons, and set that N&#257;ga gem in a ring, and put it on
the Prince&rsquo;s finger, he said, &ldquo;On the Princess&rsquo;s
asking for this ring on any day whatever,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1756src" href="#xd27e1756" name="xd27e1756src">3</a> don&rsquo;t
give it. Women are never to be trusted.&rdquo; Having taught the Prince
[this], having said, &ldquo;In any difficulty whatever, remember
me,&rdquo; the Carpenter&rsquo;s son, plunging into the water, came to
the surface of the ground, and went [back] to their city.</p>
<p>While this Prince and Princess were [there], one day she begged and
got the ring that was on the Prince&rsquo;s hand, in order to look at
it. When she begged and looked at it, this Princess saw that these
matters were written in N&#257;gara letters.</p>
<p>On the following day, begging the ring from the Prince, and having
gone noiselessly, when she held it out to the well the water dried up.
Thereupon, the Princess, having mounted upon the well mouth, and stayed
looking about, came again to the palace. In that manner, several times
begging for the ring she stayed on the well mouth, and came back.</p>
<p>One day, at the time when the Vaedd&#257; who goes hunting for the
King of that city was going walking [in the forest], the Vaedd&#257;,
having heard that this Princess sitting on the mouth of the well is
singing, went and peeped, and remained <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>looking at her.
Thereafter he went and told the King of that city, &ldquo;In such and
such a jungle there is a well. Sitting on the well mouth, a Princess
was singing and singing songs. Having stayed there, she jumped into the
well. When I went and looked there is only water. The beauty of her
figure is indeed like the sun and moon. In this city there is not a
woman of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the King having become much pleased, on the following day
the Vaedd&#257;, and the King, and the Minister, the whole three
persons, went to look at the Princess. Having gone, at the time when
they were hidden the Princess came that day also, and sitting on the
well-mouth sang songs. Thereupon the King, taking the sword, went
running to seize the Princess. As soon as the Princess saw them she
jumped into the well. The King having gone near the well, when he
looked there is only water. The Princess was not to be seen.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the King, having been astonished, came to the city.
Having come, he gave public notice by beat of tom-toms that if there
should be a person who brought and gave him the Princess who is in the
well in such and such a jungle, he will give him goods [amounting] to a
tusk-elephant&rsquo;s load, and a half share from the kingdom. [This]
he made public by the notification tom-toms.</p>
<p>At the time when they were going in the street beating the
notification tom-toms, a widow woman stopped the notification tom-toms,
and asked, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The notification tom-tom beater said, &ldquo;The King said that to a
person who brought and gave him the Princess who is in the well in such
and such a jungle, he will give these goods, and a share from the
kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the widow woman said [to the King], &ldquo;I can.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1780src" href="#xd27e1780" name="xd27e1780src">4</a>
Having constructed a watch-hut near the well in that jungle, you must
give it to me,&rdquo; she said. The King very speedily sent men, and
built a watch-hut, and gave it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17"
href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>This old woman went [there], and at the time when she was in the
watch-hut, the Princess came, and sitting down upon the well mouth,
sang songs.</p>
<p>Thereupon the widow woman, drawing together the folds of her rags,
breaking [loose] her hair and letting it hang down, placing her hand to
her head, weeping and weeping, crying and crying out, came to the place
where the Princess is.</p>
<p>The Princess asked, &ldquo;What, mother, are you weeping and weeping
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&#275;! Daughter, there is a male child of mine. The child
does not give me to eat, and does not give me to wear. Having beaten me
he drove me away, to go to any place I like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princess said, &ldquo;I will give you to eat and to wear.
There is not anyone with me.&rdquo; Calling this old woman she went to
her palace. The Prince also having become pleased, amply provided for
the old woman.</p>
<p>Very many times calling this old woman, [the Princess] having gone
to the well-mouth, and stayed [there] singing songs, returned.</p>
<p>One day this old woman, taking a piece of stone in her hand, unknown
(<i lang="si-latn">himin</i>) to the Princess, asked at the hand of the
Princess, &ldquo;An&#275;! Daughter, how does the water dry up in this
well? How does it fill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;Mother, there is a stone in my hand. By
its power the water dries up, and fills it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Saying], &ldquo;An&#275;! Daughter, where is it? Please let me,
too, look at it,&rdquo; she begged for and got the stone. Having been
looking and looking at it a little time, she dropped that piece of
stone which was in her hand, for the Princess to hear. This
gem-treasure the woman hid.</p>
<p>[The Princess] having said, &ldquo;Appoyi! Mother, you dropped the
stone!&rdquo; the two persons, striking and striking themselves, began
to cry, saying and saying, &ldquo;For us, in the midst of this forest,
from whom will there be a protection from everything (<i lang=
"si-latn">saw-saranak</i>)?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time when they were weeping and weeping, having said,
&ldquo;It is becoming night,&rdquo; the old woman said to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>Princess, &ldquo;Now then, daughter, for us two to
remain thus, a fine place (<i lang="si-latn">hari taenak</i>) is this
forest wilderness! There will be elephants, bears, leopards. Because of
that, let us go. There is my house; having gone [there], early
to-morrow morning let us come again here.&rdquo; Having said [this],
deceiving the Princess, they went away.</p>
<p>The old woman with dishonest secrecy having sent word to the King,
the King came, and calling the Princess went [with her] to the
palace.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the King published by beat of tom-toms that he has
brought the Princess who stayed on the well mouth. He made public that
on such and such a day he will marry this Princess.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Princess said, &ldquo;In that manner I cannot contract
marriage. My two parents have told me that the Prince [I am to marry]
and I, both of us, having rowed a Wooden Peacock machine<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1827src" href="#xd27e1827" name="xd27e1827src">5</a>
in the sky, and having come back, after that must contract marriage,
they have ordered.&rdquo; This word the Princess said as the Princess
knows that the first friend of the Prince&rsquo;s, that is, the
Carpenter&rsquo;s son, can construct the Wooden Peacock machine.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the King of this city employed the notification tom-tom,
&ldquo;Who can construct the Wooden Peacock machine? If there should be
a person who can, speedily come summoning him near the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time when they were beating the notification tom-tom, that
Carpenter&rsquo;s son, having caused the notification tom-tom to halt,
said, &ldquo;I can construct the Wooden Peacock machine.&rdquo;
Thereupon, summoning the Carpenter&rsquo;s son, they went to the royal
house.</p>
<p>The King ordered that he should receive from the palace many
presents. The King commanded that having quickly constructed the Wooden
Peacock machine, and also prepared a person to row it, he should bring
it.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the Carpenter&rsquo;s son, ascertaining about the
Princess who stayed at the well, quickly having set off, went near the
well in the jungle, and diving into the water, and having gone to the
palace, when he looked, the Prince <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19"
href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>having become stupefied through
want of sleep,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1842src" href="#xd27e1842"
name="xd27e1842src">6</a> had fallen down unconscious.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Carpenter&rsquo;s son, having spoken to the Prince,
said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you, Sir, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t give the
ring into the hand of the Princess,&rsquo; ascertaining that this
danger will happen? But,&rdquo; he said to the Prince,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you at any time become unhappy.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e1848src" href="#xd27e1848" name="xd27e1848src">7</a> I will
again bring the Princess near this palace, and give her to you.&rdquo;
Saying, &ldquo;Please remain in happiness,&rdquo; the Carpenter&rsquo;s
son returned to the city, and began to construct the Wooden Peacock
machine.</p>
<p>While constructing it, he made inquiry how this widow woman was,
[and learnt that] a male child of this widow woman&rsquo;s was lost
while very young (<i>lit.</i>, from his small days).</p>
<p>One day, in the night the Carpenter&rsquo;s son, tying up a bundle
of clothes and a packet of cooked rice, went, just as it was becoming
night,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1859src" href="#xd27e1859" name=
"xd27e1859src">8</a> to the house at which is the widow woman. Having
gone [there] he spoke: &ldquo;Mother, mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the woman quickly having arisen and come, asked,
&ldquo;Where, son, where were you for so many days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Carpenter&rsquo;s son said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Mother,
having tramped through many countries, I have not obtained any means of
subsistence. I obtained a few pieces of cloth and a little rice.&rdquo;
Saying &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he gave them into the hand of that
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these for, son? Look; I have received from the King
much goods, and a part of the kingdom,&rdquo; she said to the
Carpenter&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>The old woman thought he was her own son. Having allowed him to
press her eyes while she is lying down, the old woman said, &ldquo;Son,
I have still got something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Mother, where is it? Please let me
look at it,&rdquo; begging for it, when he looked [it was] that
gem-treasure.</p>
<p>Thereafter, having given it [back] into the hand of the old woman,
and waited until the time when the woman goes to sleep, stealing that
stone the Carpenter&rsquo;s son came away.</p>
<p>Then, constructing the Wooden Peacock machine, he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>went
near the King. Having gone, he said, &ldquo;Except myself no one else
can row this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time, the King and the Princess, both of them, having
mounted on the Wooden Peacock machine [after] putting on the royal
ornaments, these three persons rowed [aloft in] the Wooden Peacock
machine.</p>
<p>Having rowed very high above the sea, and stopped the Wooden Peacock
machine, the Carpenter&rsquo;s son, taking the sword in his hand, asked
the King whence the King obtained this Princess. Thereupon the King
said that a widow woman of this city brought and gave him the Princess
who stayed at a well in the midst of the forest.</p>
<p>Then the Carpenter&rsquo;s son said, &ldquo;Why do you desire
others&rsquo; wives? How much [mental] fire will there be for this
Princess&rsquo;s husband! What His Highness (<i lang=
"si-latn">tum&#257;</i>) did is a great fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, he cut down the King and dropped him into the sea,
and, taking the Princess, rowed near that well in the jungle. Having
gone [down the well] to the palace, and caused that Prince to put on
these royal ornaments, the Prince, and the Princess, and the
Carpenter&rsquo;s son, the whole three persons, having gone on the
Wooden Peacock machine to the city, and said that the King and the
Princess had contracted the marriage, that day with great festivity ate
the [wedding] feast; but any person of the city was unaware of this
abduction<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1891src" href="#xd27e1891" name=
"xd27e1891src">9</a> [of the King] which he effected.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this Prince and Princess having been saluted<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1897src" href="#xd27e1897" name=
"xd27e1897src">10</a> by that widow woman, having tried her judicially
they subjected her to the thirty-two tortures and beheaded her, and
hung her at the four gate-ways, it is said.</p>
<p>The Carpenter&rsquo;s son became the Prince&rsquo;s Prime Minister.
The Prince exercised the sovereignty with the ten [royal] virtues, it
is said.</p>

<p>Regarding the flying wooden Peacock, see also the <a href=
"#s81">next story</a> and No. 198 in vol. iii. In <i lang="fr">Cinq
Cents Contes et Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol. ii, p. 378, there is
also an account of a similar flying-machine called a Peacock, on which
a young man, accompanied by the maker, first went to marry a girl, and
afterwards, against the advice of its maker, flew aloft to show the
people his own skill. He did not know how to make it return, and at
last the cords broke, it fell in the sea, and he was drowned.</p>
<p>In <i>Folklore of the Santal Parganas</i> (collected by Rev. Dr.
Bodding), pp. 378, 380, etc., there are several accounts of houses
under the water; these were the residences of Bongas or deities.</p>
<p>In <i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. i, p. 115, Mr. G. H. Damant
gave a Bengal story in which a King&rsquo;s son descends into a well,
and finds there a Princess in a house, imprisoned by
R&#257;kshasas.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Bengal</i> (L. Behari Day), p. 17 ff., a Prince
and a Minister&rsquo;s son who was his bosom friend, while on their
travels obtained a Cobra&rsquo;s jewel, and by means of it saw a palace
under the water of a tank. They dived down to it, found a Princess who
had been imprisoned there by the Cobra, which had died on losing its
magic jewel, and the Prince married her by exchanging garlands of
flowers. After the Minister&rsquo;s son left them in order to prepare
for their return, the Princess, while the Prince was asleep, by means
of the magic jewel ascended to the surface of the water, and sat on the
bathing steps. On the third occasion when she did this, a
R&#257;ja&rsquo;s son saw and fell in love with her. As soon as she
observed him she descended to her palace, and the young man went home
apparently mad. The R&#257;ja offered his daughter&rsquo;s hand and
half his kingdom to anyone who could cure his son. An old woman who had
seen the Princess offered to do it, and a hut was built for her on the
embankment of the tank. When the Princess came to the bank the woman
offered to help her to bathe, secured the jewel, and the Princess was
captured. When the Minister&rsquo;s son returned on a day previously
arranged, he heard that the Princess was to be married in two days. He
personated the widow&rsquo;s son, who was absent, and was well received
by the widow, who handed him the magic jewel. He saw the Princess,
managed to escape with her, and they joined the Prince.</p>
<p>In <i>The Kath&#257;ko&ccedil;a</i> (Tawney), p. 91, a serpent
Prince saved a Queen who had been pushed into a well by her stepmother,
and made a palace in the well, in which she lived until she was able to
rejoin her husband.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Hindustan</i> (Shaik Chilli), p. 52, a Princess
who had been carried off and was about to be married to a
R&#257;ja&rsquo;s son, stated (by pre-arrangement with her
husband&rsquo;s party, who had come to rescue her) that it was
&ldquo;the custom of her family to float round the city in a golden
aerial car with the bridegroom and match-maker.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>The
R&#257;ja sent men to find a car. Two of her husband&rsquo;s friends, a
goldsmith and a carpenter, now produced such a car. When the R&#257;ja,
his son, the Princess, and the witch who had abducted her, began to
sail above the city in it, at the Princess&rsquo;s request the car was
stopped at a pre-arranged place, the Prince and his four friends sprang
into it, took it high in the air, drowned the R&#257;ja, his son, and
the witch, and returned with the Princess to their own city.</p>
<p>In the <i>Arabian Nights</i> (Lady Burton&rsquo;s ed., vol. iii, p.
137 ff.) there is an account of a flying ebony horse, which rose or
descended when suitable pegs were turned. When it was brought to a
Persian King, his son tried it, was carried away like the Prince in the
next story, and at last descended on the roof of a palace, where he saw
and fell in love with the royal Princess, and returning afterwards,
carried her off.</p>
<p>In the <i>Tot&#257; Kah&#257;n&#299;</i> (Small), p. 139, a young
man made a flying wooden horse, by means of which a merchant&rsquo;s
daughter, who had been abducted by a fairy, was recovered.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. i, p. 57, a young Br&#257;hma&#7751;a who plunged into the Ganges
to rescue a woman who appeared to be drowning found a temple of
&#346;iva, and a palace in which the girl who was a Daitya (an Asura)
lived.</p>
<p>In the same volume, p. 392, there is an account of a flying chariot,
&ldquo;with a pneumatic contrivance,&rdquo; made by a carpenter. A man
flew two hundred y&#333;janas (each some eight miles in length) before
descending; he then started it afresh and flew another two hundred. On
p. 390 wooden automata made by the same carpenter are mentioned; they
&ldquo;moved as if they were alive, but were recognised as lifeless by
their want of speech.&rdquo; A similar automaton is mentioned in
<i lang="fr">Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol. iii,
p. 170; it was able to sing and dance. (This work consists of
translations from the Chinese <i>Tripi&#7789;aka</i>; all appear to
have been translated from Indian originals, usually in the early
centuries after Christ.)</p>
<p>In <i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. x, p. 232 (<i>Tales of the
Panjab</i>, p. 42), in the story of Prince Lionheart, by Mrs. F. A.
Steel, his carpenter friend went in search of a Princess who had been
carried off by a King. He made a flying palankin, and returned in it
with her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=

<h2 class="main">Concerning a Royal Prince and a Princess<a class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain city there were a King, a Carpenter, and
a Washerman. There were three male children of these three persons.
They sent these three children to learn letters near a teacher a
y&#333;jana distant, or four gawuwas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1992src" href="#xd27e1992" name="xd27e1992src">2</a> distant.
These three having at one time set off from the city when they went for
[learning] letters, both that royal Prince and the Washer lad went and
said the letters; when they are coming back the Carpenter&rsquo;s son
is even yet going on the road. Those two go with much quickness.
Because of it, the Carpenter&rsquo;s son said at his father&rsquo;s
hand, &ldquo;We three having set off at one time from the city, when we
have gone, those two having got in front and gone, and said their
letters, come back. Having gone (started) at one time, on even a single
day having said my letters I was unable to come [with them].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereafter, he made for the Carpenter&rsquo;s son a [flying] Wooden
Peacock machine, and gave him it. He having gone rowing it [through the
air], and said his letters, when he is coming back those two are still
going [on the road], for [their] letters.</p>
<p>One day the royal Prince said to the Carpenter&rsquo;s son,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, will you let me row and look at the Wooden
Peacock machine?&rdquo; he asked. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24"
href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thereupon the Carpenter&rsquo;s son, having said, &ldquo;It is
good,&rdquo; and having told him the manner of treading on the chain,
gave him it. Just as the Prince was taking hold of the chain, he went
[up] in the Wooden Peacock machine, and was fixed among the clouds in
the sky. At that time the King of the city and the multitude were
frightened.</p>
<p>Thereafter, having assembled the city soothsayers and astrologers,
[the King] asked, &ldquo;When will this Prince, taking the Wooden
Peacock machine, come down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the soothsayers said, &ldquo;After he has gone for the
space of<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2009src" href="#xd27e2009" name=
"xd27e2009src">3</a> three years and three months, having come back he
will fall in the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the King said to the Ministers, &ldquo;Having been marking
that number of years and number of days, surrounding the sea
(<i>i.e.</i>, keeping a watch all along the shore), and having been
laying nets, as soon as the Prince falls you must take him
ashore,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>Thereafter, at the time when the Prince was holding the cords of the
Wooden Peacock machine, it began to descend lower. At a burial ground
at another city the Wooden Peacock machine came down upon a
Banyan-tree.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince, having placed the Wooden Peacock machine on
the tree, and descended from the tree, went to the city, and began to
walk about. At the time when the Princess of the King of the city, with
yet [other] Princesses, was bathing at a pool, the Princess saw him at
the time when this Prince also was going walking.</p>
<p>As soon as she saw him, the Princess thought, &ldquo;If I marry the
Prince it is good.&rdquo; The Prince also thought, &ldquo;If I marry
this Princess it is good.&rdquo; Except that the two thought to
themselves of each other, there was no means of talking together.
Because of it, the Princess, plucking a blue-lotus flower in the pool,
placed it on her head after having smelt (kissed) it; and again, having
crushed it, threw it down, and trampled on it. The Princess did thus
for the Prince to perceive that when he married her she would be
submissive and obedient to him. The Prince understood it, and kept it
in mind. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thereafter, at the time when the Prince was going walking in the
city, he met with the palace in which is the Princess. At the time when
the Prince had been there a little while, the Princess opened a window
of the upper story, and when she was looking in the direction of the
street, saw that this Prince was [there], and spoke to him. At that
time she said to the Prince, &ldquo;After it has become night I [shall]
have opened this window. You come [then].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince having come after all in the palace got to sleep,
when he looked the window was opened. Having spoken to the Princess, he
entered the palace. The two having conversed, the Prince, before it
became light, got out of the palace, and having gone away, and waited
until the time when it became night, comes again.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Princess, in order to keep the Prince in the very
palace, told a smith of the city to come secretly; and having given him
also a thousand masuran, and made the man thoroughly swear [to
secrecy], the Princess said, &ldquo;Having made a large lamp-stand, and
made it [large enough] for a man to be inside it, and turned round the
screw-key belonging to it, as though bringing it to sell bring it to
the palace. When you bring it I will tell the King, and I will take
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smith having gone, and made the lamp-stand in the manner the
Princess said, brought it near the King. Then the Princess having come
and said, &ldquo;I want this,&rdquo; took it, and put it in the palace.
To the smith the King gave five hundred masuran.</p>
<p>Thereafter, having put that Prince inside the lamp-stand, he
remained [there]. When not many days had gone by, the Princess became
pregnant. The King having perceived that the Princess was pregnant,
placed a guard round the palace, and having published by beat of
tom-toms [that they were] to seize this thief, the King and the guards
made all possible effort to seize the thief, but they were unable.</p>
<p>A widow woman said, &ldquo;I can seize him if you will allow me to
go evening and morning to the palace in which is the Princess, to seize
the thief.&rdquo; Thereupon the King gave <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>permission to the woman
to go and stay during the whole<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2040src"
href="#xd27e2040" name="xd27e2040src">4</a> of both times.</p>
<p>When several days had gone by, this woman, having perceived that a
man is inside that lamp-stand, one day having gone taking also a
package of fine sand, during the visit, while she stayed talking and
talking with the Princess put the sand of the package round the
lamp-stand, and having spread it thinly, came away. The Princess was
unable to find this out.</p>
<p>When that woman went on the morning of the following day, and
looked, the Prince&rsquo;s foot-prints were in that sand. As soon as
she saw it, the woman went and said to the King, &ldquo;I caught the
thief. Let us go to look.&rdquo; The old woman having gone, said,
&ldquo;There! It is inside that lamp-stand, indeed, that the thief
is,&rdquo; and showed them to the King. At that time, when the King
broke the lamp-stand and looked, the thief was [there].</p>
<p>Thereafter the King gave orders that having tortured the thief, and
taken him away, they were to behead him, he said to the executioners.
Thereupon the executioners [after] pinioning the Prince, beating the
execution tom-tom, took him to that burial-ground.</p>
<p>At that time the Prince said to the executioners, &ldquo;If you kill
any person, having given him the things he thinks of to eat and
drink&mdash;is it not so?&mdash;you kill him. Because of it, until the
time when I come [after] going into this Banyan-tree and eating two
Banyan fruits, remain on guard round this tree. There is no opportunity
(<i lang="si-latn">taenak</i>) for me to bound off and go
elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, the executioners having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo;
the Prince ascended the tree, and having mounted on that Wooden Peacock
machine, rowed into the sky. While the executioners were looking the
Prince went flying away.</p>
<p>The executioners having said that blame will fall [on them] from the
King, caught and cut a lizard (<i lang=
"si-latn">ka&#7789;uss&#257;</i>), and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>having gone [after]
rubbing the blood on the sword, showed it to the King, and said that
they beheaded the thief.</p>
<p>From that day, the Princess from grief remained without eating and
drinking. Several days afterwards, the Prince, having come rowing the
Wooden Peacock machine, and caused it to stop on the palace in which is
the Princess, and having removed the tiles, dropped the jewelled ring
that was on the Prince&rsquo;s hand at the place where the Princess is.
He also dropped a robe of the Prince&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Princess, getting to know about the Prince&rsquo;s
[being on the roof], threw up the cloth [again]. Tying the hand-line to
descend by, at that time the Prince, having descended, said to the
Princess, &ldquo;To kill me they took me to the burial-ground. I having
caused the executioners to be deceived, and climbed up the
tree&mdash;my Wooden Peacock machine was on the tree&mdash;I mounted it
and went rowing away.&rdquo; Thereafter, the Prince and Princess, both
of them, went away.</p>
<p>At the time when they were going, ten months were completed for the
Princess. While they were going, pains began to seize her. [The Prince]
having lowered the Wooden Peacock machine in a great forest jungle, and
in a minute having made a house of branches, the Princess bore [a
child].</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince said, &ldquo;Remain here until I go and bring a
little fire.&rdquo; Saying [this] to the Princess, the Prince went
rowing the Wooden Peacock machine. Having gone, at the time when,
taking the fire in a coconut husk, he was coming rowing the Wooden
Peacock machine over the midst of the sea, the coconut husk having
burnt, the fire seized the Wooden Peacock machine, and it burnt
away.</p>
<p>The Prince having come [there], fell in the sea. That foretold
number of years also had been finished on that day. The person who
stayed casting nets in the sea [there], as soon as the Prince fell got
him ashore. The Prince, planting a vegetable garden at the city,
remained there.</p>
<p>While the Princess who bore [the child] in that forest jungle was
without any protection from all things (<i lang=
"si-latn">sawu-saranak</i>), this trouble having become visible to an
ascetic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>person who practises austerity in that forest
jungle, he came to the place where the Princess was, and spoke to
her.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Princess, after she saw the ascetic, having a little
abandoned the trouble that was in her mind, said to the ascetic,
&ldquo;While I walk into the midst of this forest seeking a little ripe
fruit, will you look after this child until I come?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>The ascetic said, &ldquo;Should I hold the child it is impure
(<i lang="si-latn">kilutu</i>) for me. Because of it, you having made a
stick platform (<i lang="si-latn">maessak</i>), and hung it by a
creeper, and having tied a creeper to the platform, go after having
sent the child to sleep on the platform. At the time when the child
cries I will come, and hold the creeper by the end, and shake it; then
the child will stop.&rdquo; Having done in the manner the ascetic said,
the Princess, seeking ripe fruits, ate.</p>
<p>One day, the Princess having suckled the child, and sent it to sleep
on the platform, went to seek ripe fruits. Thereafter, that child
having rolled off the stick platform and fallen on the ground, at the
time when it was crying the ascetic heard it, and came; when he looked,
the child having rolled over had fallen on the ground. Thereupon,
because it was impure for the ascetic to hold the child, he plucked a
flower, and having performed an Act of Truth for the flower, thought,
&ldquo;May a child be created just like this child.&rdquo; Thereafter,
a child was created just like it.</p>
<p>The Princess having come back, and having seen, when she looked,
that two children are [there], the Princess asked the ascetic,
&ldquo;What is [the reason of] it? To-day two children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ascetic said, &ldquo;When I was coming, the child, having
fallen, was crying and crying. Because it is impure for me to hold the
child, I created a child just like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;I cannot believe that word. If so, you
must create a child again, for me to look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the ascetic said, &ldquo;According to the difficulty there
is for you to rear one child, when there are three how much difficulty
[will there be]!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter. [Please] create and give me it; I can rear
it.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thereupon, the ascetic plucked a flower, and having performed an Act
of Truth, when he put it on the stick platform a child was created just
like it.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the Princess having been pleased, reared the children.
The children having grown up, walked in the midst of the forest,
seeking ripe fruits, and having come back the children gave them to
their mother, and [then] began to eat.</p>
<p>One day, at the time when these three are going walking, they met
with a great river. When they looked, on the other bank of the river a
great vegetable garden is visible. Thereupon these three having said
[to each other], &ldquo;Can you swim?&rdquo; swam a considerable
distance, and came back, saying, &ldquo;Let us come to-morrow
morning.&rdquo; Having gone seeking a very few ripe fruits, they gave
them to their mother.</p>
<p>On the following day, early in the morning, taking bows and arrows,
the whole three went to the edge of the river. Having gone [there], and
the whole three having gone swimming to the vegetable garden, when they
looked many kinds of ripe fruits were [there].</p>
<p>Thereafter, these three having plucked [some], at the time when they
are eating them the gardeners who watch the garden saw them, and having
come running, prepared (<i>lit.</i>, made) to seize them. Thereupon
these three, taking their bows, prepared to shoot. The gardeners
bounded off, and having gone running, told it at the hand of the
King.</p>
<p>These three having eaten as much as possible, [after] plucking a
great many crossed over [the river], and went away. At that time the
King said to the gardeners, &ldquo;Should these thieves come to-morrow
also, let me know very speedily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following day, also, those three persons came, and at the time
when they are plucking [the fruit], the gardeners went and told him.
Thereupon the King, taking bows and arrows, came and shot at them. When
he shot, the arrow having gone, when near these Princes turned
(<i>lit.</i>, looked) back, and fell down.</p>
<p>Thereafter, that party shot at the King. Then also, in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>the very
[same] way, the arrow having gone, when near the King turned (looked)
back, and fell down.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the whole two parties, after having come near [each
other], spoke, &ldquo;This was a great wonder. The circumstance that
out of the two parties no one was struck, is a great wonder. Because of
it, let us, the whole two parties, go near the
pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257;s [for them] to explain this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, the whole of the two parties having gone, told the
pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257;s this circumstance that had occurred. Then
the pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257;s, having explained it, said to the King,
&ldquo;You, Sir, now above three or four years ago, summoned a Princess
[in marriage]. The Princess&rsquo;s, indeed, are these three, the
children born to you, Sir. Because of it, the Gods have caused this to
be seen. Go, and summoning the Princess from the place where she is,
[be pleased] to come,&rdquo; the pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257;s said to
the King.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the King having remembered her, at that moment
decorating a ship, with the sound of the five musical instruments he
went into the midst of the forest in which is that Princess; and having
come back [after] calling the Princess, the Princess, and the three
Princes, and the King remained at the garden, it is said.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In <i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i>
(Swynnerton), p. 9, a Prince mounted on a magic wooden flying-horse
that a friend of his, a carpenter&rsquo;s son, had brought to the
palace, and flew away on it. The carpenter promised that it would
return in two months. The Prince alighted by moonlight on a palace roof
five hundred leagues away, and fell in love with a Princess whom he saw
there. After they had conversed, he flew off, fixed the horse in pieces
amid the branches of a large tree, and stayed at a widow&rsquo;s house,
returning each night to the palace. In the end he was arrested and
condemned to death. When the executioners were about to hang him he got
permission to climb up the tree, put the horse together, sailed back to
the palace, and carried off the Princess to his father&rsquo;s
home.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Fairy Tales</i> (M. Stokes), p. 158, a Prince who had
stolen a magic bed which transported those who sat on it wherever
desired, visited a Princess at night by means of it, and afterwards
married her.</p>
<p>In the same work, p. 208, a Prince and Princess saw each other at a
fair. While the Prince watched her from his tent, she took a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>rose in her hand, put it to her teeth, stuck it
behind her ear, and lastly laid it at her feet. The Prince could not
understand her meaning, but a friend explained it, and said that she
intended him to know that her father&rsquo;s name was Raja D&#257;nt
(King Tooth), her country the Karn&#257;tak (<i lang=
"si-latn">kar&#7751;a</i> = ear), and her own name P&#257;nwpatt&#299;
(Foot-leaf).</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. i, p. 487, it is stated that while S&#299;t&#257;, the wife of
R&#257;ma, was dwelling at V&#257;lm&#299;ki&rsquo;s hermitage with her
infant son Lava, she took the child with her when she went to bathe one
day. The hermit, thinking a wild beast had carried it off, created
another child resembling it, from ku&#347;a grass, and placed it in the
hut. On her return he explained the matter to her, and she adopted the
infant, to which the name Ku&#347;a was given.</p>
<p>In the same work, vol. ii, p. 235, a girl who came to bathe gave
signals to a Prince by means of a lotus flower, which she put in her
ear, and then twisted into the form of an ornament called
<i>dantapatra</i>, or tooth-leaf. After this she placed another lotus
flower on her head, and laid her hand on her heart.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i> (Knowles), 2nd ed., p. 215, a
Princess covered her face with lotus petals, and held up an ivory box
to be seen by a Prince who was looking at her. By these signals he
learnt her name and that of her city. He went to the city, visited her
each day in a magic swing, and at length they eloped and were
married.</p>
<p>In <i>Sagas from the Far East</i>, p. 110, a wood-carver&rsquo;s son
fashioned a hollow flying Garu&#7693;a (possibly in the form of a
Brahminy Kite), inside which a friend whose wife had been abducted flew
to the Khan&rsquo;s palace where she was detained, and brought her
away.</p>
<p>In the same work, p. 316, a Princess made signals to a King&rsquo;s
young Minister as follows: She raised the first finger of her right
hand, then passed the other hand round it, clasped and unclasped her
hands, and finally laid one finger of each hand beside that of the
other hand, and pointed with them towards the palace.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata</i> and <i lang=
"sa-latn">R&#257;m&#257;yana</i> javelins or arrows are sometimes
represented as returning to the sender, who in such cases was a being
possessing supernatural power. Thus, according to one story of
Daksha&rsquo;s sacrifice, when the energy of a dart thrown by Rudra at
Vish&#7751;u was neutralised, it returned to Rudra. In the fight
between Kar&#7751;a and Arjuna some arrows which the former discharged
returned to him (<i lang="sa-latn">Kar&#7751;a Parva</i>, lxxxix.).</p>
<p>In performing an Act of Truth such as is mentioned in this story,
the person first states a fact and then utters a wish, which in reality
is a conjuration, the efficacy of which depends on the truth of the
foregoing statement.</p>
<p>Thus, in the <i>J&#257;taka</i><a id="xd27e2202" name=
"xd27e2202"></a> No. 35 (vol. i, p. 90) the B&#333;dhisatta in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>form of a helpless quail nestling<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2206src" href="#xd27e2206" name="xd27e2206src">5</a>
extinguished a raging bush fire that was about to destroy it and other
birds, by an Act of Truth, which took this form:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;With wings that fly not, feet that walk not,</p>
<p class="line">Forsaken by my parents here I lie!</p>
<p class="line">Wherefore I conjure thee, dread Lord of Fire,</p>
<p class="line">Prim&aelig;val J&#257;taveda, turn! go back!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The account then continues: &ldquo;Even as he
performed his Act of Truth, J&#257;taveda [the Fire Deity] went back a
space of sixteen lengths; and in going back the flames did not pass
away to the forest, devouring everything in their path. No; they went
out there and then, like a torch plunged in water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are several other examples in the J&#257;taka stories, and one
in No. 83 in this volume. In the first volume, p. 140, the Prince cut
in two the gem through the efficacy of an Act of Truth expressed in a
slightly different form: &ldquo;If so-and-so be true, may so-and-so
happen.&rdquo; This is the usual type of the conjuration; it occurs
also in the story numbered 11. See also the <i lang=
"sa-latn">Mah&#257;vansa</i>, Professor Geiger&rsquo;s translation, p.
125, footnote.</p>
<p>Other examples are given in the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit
S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney), vol. i, p. 330, vol. ii, p. 82; <i>Sagas from
the Far East</i>, p. 47; Von Schiefner&rsquo;s <i>Tibetan Tales</i>
(Ralston), p. 284; <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues</i>,
vol. ii, pp. 358, 396; and in the <i lang="sa-latn">Mah&#257;
Bh&#257;rata</i>.</p>
<p>In chapter xvii. of the <i lang="sa-latn">Mah&#257;vansa</i>
(Professor Geiger&rsquo;s translation, p. 118), King Tissa proved the
authenticity of the collar-bone relic of Buddha by an asseveration of
this kind. In chapter xviii. (p. 125), the Emperor A&#347;&#333;ka
severed the branch of the B&#333;-tree at Gay&#257;, in order to send
it to Ceylon, by an Act of Truth, previously drawing a magic line with
a pencil of red arsenic round the branch to mark the place where it was
to break off. In chapter xxv. (p. 171), King
Du&#7789;&#7789;ha-G&#257;ma&#7751;i by similar means is said to have
caused the armour of his troops to take the colour of fire, so that
they might be discriminated from the Tamils whom he was fighting.</p>
<p>With regard to the messages given by signals, the reader may
remember Rabelais&rsquo; account of the argument by signs between
Panurge and Thaumaste (<i>Pantagruel</i>, cap. xix.).</p>
<p>Kandian girls make almost imperceptible signals to each other. If
without moving the head the eyes be momentarily directed towards the
door, the question is asked, &ldquo;Shall we go out?&rdquo; An
affirmative reply is given by an expressionless gaze, a negative one by
closing the eyes for an instant. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33"

<h2 class="main">The Princes who Learnt the Sciences</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain city there is a King, it is said. There
are four Princes (sons) of the King, it is said. At the time when he
told the four persons to learn the sciences that are [known] in that
country, they were unable to learn the sciences.</p>
<p>After that, the King, bringing a sword, told them to [go elsewhere
and] learn the sciences [or he would kill them].</p>
<p>So all the four Princes, tying up a bundle of cooked rice, went
away, and having gone to yet a city and sat down at a halting-place
(<i lang="si-latn">r&#363;ppayak</i>), the eldest Prince said,
&ldquo;At the time when we are coming back we must assemble together at
this very halting-place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the eldest Prince arrived (<i lang=
"si-latn">baehun&#257;ya</i>) at a city. At the time when he asked,
&ldquo;What is the science that is [known] in this city?&rdquo; they
said, &ldquo;In this city there is sooth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go and send me to the house where they say
sooth,&rdquo; he said. Then they went and sent him. The Prince learnt
sooth.</p>
<p>The next (<i lang="si-latn">etanama</i>) Prince arrived (<i lang=
"si-latn">baess&#257;</i>) at a city. He asked, &ldquo;What is the
science that is [known] in this city?&rdquo; &ldquo;In this city there
is theft,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go and conduct me to the house where theft is
[known],&rdquo; he said. That one learnt theft.</p>
<p>The next Prince went and arrived at a city. &ldquo;What is the
science that is [known] in this city?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Archery
is [known] in this city,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go and send me to the house where there is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>archery,&rdquo; he said. They went and sent him.
That one learnt archery.</p>
<p>The next Prince went and arrived at a city. &ldquo;What is the
science that is [known] in this city?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;In this
city there is carpenter&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go and send me to the house where there is
carpenter&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; he said. That one learnt
carpenter&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>After that, the soothsayer [Prince] looked into the sooth, [to
ascertain] on what day the other three persons would come. When he
looked, it appeared that on the very day when the eldest Prince comes
back the other three persons also will come.</p>
<p>The eldest Prince having set off and come, returned to the
halting-place (<i lang="si-latn">r&#363;pp&#275;</i>) at which they
stayed that day. Having come, while he was there the other three also
came and arrived at that halting-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the science you learnt?&rdquo; they asked from the
eldest Prince. &ldquo;I learnt sooth,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>They asked the next Prince, &ldquo;What is the science you
learnt?&rdquo; &ldquo;I learnt theft,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>They asked the next Prince, &ldquo;What is the science you
learnt?&rdquo; &ldquo;I learnt archery,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>They asked the young Prince, &ldquo;What is the science you
learnt?&rdquo; &ldquo;I learnt carpenter&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; said the
young Prince.</p>
<p>The three persons asked the eldest Prince, &ldquo;What is there at
our house?&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;On the Palmira-tree a female
crow (<i lang="si-latn">kawa&#7693;i</i>), having laid three eggs, is
sitting on them,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is missing from our house?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;The
R&#257;kshasa having taken the King&rsquo;s Queen to that [far] shore
of the sea, [after] putting her in the middle room (<i>lit.</i>, house)
in the midst of seven,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2326src" href=
"#xd27e2326" name="xd27e2326src">1</a> has put the seven keys in his
mouth,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, the whole seven came to the city. The King having come
rubbing (whetting) a sword, asked the eldest <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>Prince,
&ldquo;What is the science you learnt?&rdquo; &ldquo;I learnt
sooth,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He asked the next Prince, &ldquo;What is the science you
learnt?&rdquo; &ldquo;I learnt theft.&rdquo; He asked the next Prince;
&ldquo;I learnt archery.&rdquo; He asked the youngest Prince,
&ldquo;What is the science you learnt?&rdquo; &ldquo;I learnt
carpenter&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; the King asked, &ldquo;What
is there at my house?&rdquo; &ldquo;On the Palmira-tree a female crow
is sitting on three eggs,&rdquo; [the eldest Prince] said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is lost from my house?&rdquo; he asked, to look [if he
knew]. &ldquo;The R&#257;kshasa having gone away, and put the
King&rsquo;s Queen in the middle house (room) in the midst of seven,
has placed the seven keys in his mouth,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doer of theft, without the female crow&rsquo;s flying away,
while it is [sitting there] in that manner, take an egg, and come
back,&rdquo; he said. Without the crow&rsquo;s flying away, while it
was [sitting] in that manner he took an egg, and came back.</p>
<p>Having caused the egg to be buried under the rice winnowing tray, he
said, &ldquo;Archer, without swerving to that side or this side, shoot
[for the arrow] to go cutting it quite across.&rdquo; He shot so as to
go quite across.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doer of carpenter&rsquo;s work, fasten this [egg] in the very
manner in which it was [at first],&rdquo; he said. He fastened it in
the very way in which it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robber, without the crow&rsquo;s flying (<i lang=
"si-latn">padinn&#275;</i>), go and place [the egg in the nest], and
come back,&rdquo; he said. He went and placed it [in the nest], and
came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you bring back this Queen?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;We
can,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>The whole four persons having gone, the thief went into the
[R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s] house, and brought out the Queen successfully.
When he was bringing her the R&#257;kshasa was asleep. Taking the
Queen, they came away.</p>
<p>When they were coming, they told [the soothsaying Prince] to look by
[means of] sooth [what the R&#257;kshasa was doing]. Still he slept.
Having come very far in that way, they told him to look [again].
&ldquo;He is now coming on the path,&rdquo; he said. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>When they were returning thus, [the R&#257;kshasa], having come
quite near, sprang at them. At that very time the archer shot [at him;
the arrow] having gone cutting his neck, he fell.</p>
<p>The ship in which they had gone was damaged (<i lang=
"si-latn">tuw&#257;la wun&#257;</i>). The carpenter made [the damage
good]. Then, [after crossing the sea] they brought the
R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s head and the Queen, and gave them to the King.
Thereupon the King gave them the sovereignty.</p>
<p>Then the soothsayer says, &ldquo;[The sovereignty ought to belong to
me]. Through my looking at the sooth, indeed, ye will get the country,
[if ye receive it],&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the thief says, &ldquo;[The sovereignty ought to belong to me].
It was necessary that I should go and take [the Queen] successfully
from the R&#257;kshasa. [If ye get it], it is owing to me that ye will
get the country,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the archer says, &ldquo;[The sovereignty ought to belong to
me]. When the R&#257;kshasa came in order to go [after] eating you,
through my having shot him and killed him ye will get the country [if
ye receive it].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Carpenter says, &ldquo;[The sovereignty ought to belong to
me]. Your ship having broken, by my fastening it [together] at the time
when it was becoming rotten, ye will get the country [if ye receive
it].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards they gave the sovereignty to the eldest Prince.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a city there are five sons of a nobleman. In yet
[another] city there is a Princess without both parents. The Princess
is a person possessing many articles. Having <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>thought
that when the eldest son of the nobleman went there she must make him
stop [there], and having spoken with the Princess&rsquo;s kinsfolk
[regarding it], the eldest son having gone near the Princess she caused
him to remain.</p>
<p>After he stayed there many days, this Princess asks this
nobleman&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;What do you know of the sciences?&rdquo;
Then he says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a single one.&rdquo; Having
said, &ldquo;If so, you cannot stay near me; go you away,&rdquo; she
drove him away.</p>
<p>This nobleman&rsquo;s son came home. The nobleman asks his son,
&ldquo;What have you come for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Princess asked me, &lsquo;What do you know of the
sciences?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything.&rsquo;
&lsquo;If so, you cannot stay near me,&rsquo; she said. Because of that
I came,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Immediately, this nobleman says to all his five sons, &ldquo;Unless
you five learn five sciences, without [doing so] don&rsquo;t come to my
house.&rdquo; Having said it he drove them away. Thereupon, these five
persons went to five cities, and learning five sciences, after much
time came home. [One was a soothsayer, the second was a marksman, the
third a thief, the fourth made very rapid journeys, and the fifth could
bring the dead to life.]</p>
<p>This nobleman, after that having summoned the eldest son, asked,
&ldquo;What is the science that thou knowest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know [how] to tell sooth,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>To look at this one&rsquo;s knowledge, the nobleman, having seen
that a female crow had laid eggs in a tree, said, <span class="corr"
id="xd27e2430" title="Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>Should you tell me
the sooth that I ask, you are [really] an astrologer.&rdquo; Having
given his son betel he asked it [mentally].</p>
<p>After he asked it, this one says, &ldquo;Father, you have asked me
if a female crow has laid eggs in a tree. Is it not so?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the nobleman said to the one who was able to shoot,
&ldquo;Come here. Without the female crow&rsquo;s knowing it, and
without breaking the egg, shoot thou so that it may become marked
[only],&mdash;an egg out of the eggs that are in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>that
nest,&rdquo; he said. The nobleman&rsquo;s son having said, &ldquo;It
is good,&rdquo; shot in the manner he told him.</p>
<p>Then this nobleman, having summoned the thief, says, &ldquo;Go thou,
and without the crow&rsquo;s knowing, bring thou only the egg which
this one shot.&rdquo; Having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; he brought
that very egg.</p>
<p>Then the nobleman said, &ldquo;Go again, and place thou it [back in
the nest].&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and went and put
it [back].</p>
<p>Thereupon, [having called the eldest son again], what sooth did the
nobleman ask? Thinking it in his mind [only], he asked, &ldquo;How are
now the happiness and health of the Princess whom you at first summoned
[in marriage]?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he asked, this one having looked at the sooth, says,
&ldquo;The Princess having now died, they have taken her to
bury,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the nobleman said to the one who is able to go on rapid
journeys, &ldquo;Go, and do not allow them to bury her&rdquo;; he went
accordingly.</p>
<p>Then this nobleman said to the one who causes life to be
restored,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2452src" href="#xd27e2452" name=
"xd27e2452src">3</a> &ldquo;Go and restore the life of the Princess,
and come thou back to my city.&rdquo; Having said, &ldquo;It is
good,&rdquo; this one went, and, causing her life to be restored, the
person who made rapid journeys, and the one who caused life to be
restored, and the Princess, all three persons, came to the
nobleman&rsquo;s city.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince who caused her life to be restored, says,
&ldquo;I shall take the Princess whose life I caused to be
restored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the person who went on rapid journeys says, &ldquo;Unless I had
gone quickly, and had not allowed them to bury her, and if they had
buried her, how would you take her? Because it is so, I shall take
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the soothsayer says, &ldquo;If I had not looked at the sooth,
and told [you about her death], how would you two take her? Because it
is so, I shall take her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the nobleman says, &ldquo;Unless I caused the sooth to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=

href="#xd27e2466" name="xd27e2466src">4</a> how would you three
otherwise take her? Because it is so, I shall take her.&rdquo; Owing to
that, these four persons were quarrelling.</p>
<p>Now then, out of these four persons, to whom does she belong?
According to our thinking, indeed, she belongs to the nobleman.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain city there are a King and a Queen. There
are seven Princes of the King. The King every day [goes] to fish
(<i>lit.</i>, to lower bait).</p>
<p>One day, the Princes having said, &ldquo;Let us also go to look at
the fishing,&rdquo; the King and the seven Princes went to the river to
fish. The King having fished three L&#803;&#363;ll&#363;,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2492src" href="#xd27e2492" name="xd27e2492src">5</a>
gave them into the hand of the seven Princes to bring.</p>
<p>The youngest Prince said, &ldquo;Elder brother, let us put these
into the water to look if they go down (sink).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards they put the three fishes in the water. Two went down;
one remained over. Taking that fish, the seven Princes came to the
city. Having come, and given it into the hand of the Queen, they said,
&ldquo;Our father the King gave us three
L&#803;&#363;ll&#803;&#363;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2505src" href=
"#xd27e2505" name="xd27e2505src">6</a> When we were bringing them
younger brother said to us, &lsquo;Let us place the three
L&#803;&#363;llu in the water to look if they go down.&rsquo;
Afterwards we placed them [in it]. Then two L&#803;&#363;llu went down;
this L&#803;&#363;l&#257; remained over. Having cooked this one for our
father the King, cook for us and give us a packet of rice,&rdquo; they
said. The Queen having cooked and placed [ready] the L&#363;l&#257; for
the King, cooked a packet of rice for the seven Princes, and gave
it.</p>
<p>After that, the seven Princes, taking the packet of cooked
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>rice, went away.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2512src" href="#xd27e2512" name="xd27e2512src">7</a> Having thus
gone, the whole seven ate the packet of cooked rice near a piece of
garden. When the whole seven were going away again, they met with a
soothsayer. Then the eldest Prince said, &ldquo;I must stay near this
soothsayer,&rdquo; and having said it he stopped near the
soothsayer.</p>
<p>When the other six persons were going away, they met with a man who
knows the crows&rsquo; language. After that, the next Prince stayed
near the man who knows the crows&rsquo; language. When the other five
were going away they met with a shooter<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2517src" href="#xd27e2517" name="xd27e2517src">8</a>; near the
shooter stayed the next Prince. When the other four were going away
they met with a plough carpenter; near the carpenter stayed the next
Prince. When the other three were going away they met with a
ball-playing man; near the ball-playing man stayed the next Prince.
When the other two were going away they met with a gang of thieves;
both of them stayed near the gang of thieves.</p>
<p>A long time the two persons in the gang of thieves remained breaking
and breaking into houses. Having been thus and thus, the two persons
spoke together: &ldquo;Seeking articles [to take back with us] let us
go to look at our elder brothers.&rdquo; Having said [this, after]
getting the articles they came near the Prince who stayed near the man
who is striking balls. When they looked he was learning to play at
balls better than the ball-playing man.</p>
<p>That Prince said, &ldquo;Let us go to see the other [next] elder
brother of ours.&rdquo; Having said [this], the three Princes came near
the Prince who remained near the plough-carpenter; when they looked the
Prince also was learning to bore (<i lang="si-latn">widin&#7693;a</i>)
ploughs better than the plough-carpenter.</p>
<p>That Prince said, &ldquo;Let us go to the place where elder brother
is.&rdquo; They came to look at the Prince who remained near the
shooter. Having come there, when they looked he, also, was learning to
shoot better than the shooter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41"
href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p>After that, the Prince said, &ldquo;Let us go to look at that other
elder brother of ours.&rdquo; They came near the Prince who remained
near the man who knows the crows&rsquo; language. Having come there,
when they looked he, also, was learning the crows&rsquo; language
better than the man who knows the crows&rsquo; language.</p>
<p>After that, the Prince said, &ldquo;Let us go near that other elder
brother of ours, near the Prince who remained near the
soothsayer.<span class="corr" id="xd27e2535" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> The whole of the six Princes having
come, when they looked he, also, was learning to say sooth better than
the soothsayer.</p>
<p>After that, the whole of the seven Princes having [thus] met
together, came to the Princes&rsquo; city. Thereupon, the King and the
seven Princes went to the river to bathe. When they were bathing a crow
cawed; then the King said, &ldquo;Who can explain the language of that
crow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince who knows the crows&rsquo; language said, &ldquo;I
can. That cawed, having been at the place where it is roosting on the
eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;Who can take the eggs by stealth [without
disturbing the crow]?&rdquo; The two who stayed in the gang of thieves
having said, &ldquo;We can,&rdquo; the two Princes taking the crow-eggs
gave them to the King.</p>
<p>After that the King and the seven Princes having come to the city,
the King asked, &ldquo;Who can say sooth?&rdquo; The eldest Prince
said, &ldquo;I can,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;Look and find by sooth seven Princesses for
you seven persons,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Prince having looked by sooth, said, &ldquo;At such
and such a city there is a Princess; at such and such a city there is a
Princess.&rdquo; Saying and saying [this], he mentioned separately
seven Princesses who are at seven cities.</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;Who can, [after] stealing them, come with
those seven Princesses?&rdquo; The two who remained in the gang of
thieves having said, &ldquo;We can,&rdquo; that day night having gone
and having stolen two and come back, he gave the two Princesses to the
eldest elder brother and the next elder brother. <span class=

<p>On the following day night having gone and having come back [after]

<p>On the following day they went, and [after] stealing two Princesses
for the [next] two persons, thereafter they went back to the very gang

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A certain Br&#257;hma&#7751;a had a daughter named
Candr&#257;pat&#299;. She was a person endowed with beauty. Four
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a Princes having heard of the excellence of her
figure, came to try to marry her. The Br&#257;hma&#7751;a her father
having inquired what sciences they knew, each one said that he did not
know [any]. He said that he could not marry and give the
Princess-daughter to them.</p>
<p>Thereupon, they four having arrived at shame, came near a
travellers&rsquo; rest-house, and conversing [said], &ldquo;We four
persons having gone separately to districts for learning sciences,
[after] three months in succession again let us arrive at this very
place.&rdquo; Promising [this], and having looked in the four
directions, they departed. In this manner the four of them having
arrived each in a different district, and having [become] conversant
with the sciences,&mdash;looking at omens, going in the sky, abating
poison, giving life [anew,&mdash;after] three months in succession
arrived at the aforesaid travellers&rsquo; rest-house.</p>
<p>Thereafter, they four again departed for taking in marriage the
Princess. At that time a H&#363;n&#257; (House Lizard) cried. Then the
person who was clever at omens told the remaining three persons that a
cobra having bitten the Princess, they are taking her to the grave at
that time.</p>
<p>Thereupon the person who possessed the power of flight through the
air, having gone by the power of flight through <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>the air,
together with the other three, halted at the grave of the dead body.
Then the poison discharger reduced the poison; the other gave her
life.</p>
<p>Afterwards, while the four of them are one by one boasting of the
gain due to themselves, they quarrelled over it. For that reason, not
obtaining the Princess, they again went away.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit
S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney), vol. ii, p. 349, four Br&#257;hma&#7751;a
brothers decided to &ldquo;search through the earth and acquire some
magic power.&rdquo; So they separated and went east, west, north, and
south, after fixing upon a meeting-place. The rest of the story differs
from the Sinhalese one; they met together, found a piece of bone, gave
it flesh, hide, limbs, and life, so that it became a lion which killed
them.</p>
<p>In the same work, vol. i, p. 499, four men wanted to marry a
Princess; one was a clever weaver, one a Vai&#347;ya who knew the
language of beasts and birds, the third a Kshatriya who was an expert
swordsman, the fourth a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a who could raise the dead to
life. She refused all four, and died after three months, and the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a was unable to restore life to her corpse as she was
only human owing to a curse which had come to an end. See also vol. ii,
p. 276.</p>
<p>In the same work, vol. ii, pp. 242, 258, there are variants in the
series of Trivikramas&#275;na and the V&#275;t&#257;la, the second one
being like the Sinhalese tales in several respects. The father promised
a girl to a man who had magic power, the mother promised her to one who
had knowledge, her brother promised her to a hero. When they all came
on the appointed day, she had disappeared. The learned man ascertained
that she had been abducted by a R&#257;kshasa, the magician prepared a
magic chariot in which all three went to rescue her, and the hero
killed the R&#257;kshasa. Each one claimed her in a similar form of
words to that employed by the learned man, who said, &ldquo;If I had
not known where this maiden was, how would she have been discovered
when concealed?&rdquo; The King decided that the hero ought to marry
her.</p>
<p>In the <i>Tot&#257; Kah&#257;n&#299;</i> (Small), p. 51, a
carpenter, goldsmith, tailor, and hermit, halting in a forest one night
and each working in turn, carved the figure of a beautiful woman, robed
it, adorned it, and caused it to be endowed with life. In the morning
they quarrelled regarding the ownership of the woman, and all those to
whom the matter was referred also claimed her. When the decision was
left to a large old tree, &ldquo;the tree of decision,&rdquo; it burst
open, and the woman entering it became wood once more. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the same work, p. 139, three young men saved a merchant&rsquo;s
daughter from a fairy who had abducted her. One discovered where she
was, the second made a flying wooden horse, on which the third rode and
brought her back after killing the fairy. They then quarrelled
regarding their claims to marry her. The parrot which related the story
considered that she belonged to the last one because he risked his life
for her.</p>
<p>At p. 157 also, a girl&rsquo;s husband who had vowed to offer his
own head to a deity in case he married her, decapitated himself at the
temple. A Br&#257;hma&#7751;a who entered feared he would be charged
with murdering him, and cut off his head also. The girl came, and was
about to follow their example when a voice from the shrine informed her
that if she joined the heads to the trunks the two persons would be
restored to life. In doing this she misplaced the heads, and both
persons then claimed her. The parrot was of opinion that she belonged
to the man with her husband&rsquo;s head. There is a variant in the
<i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney), vol. ii,
p. 261, the second man being the girl&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p>In <i>Sagas from the Far East</i>, p. 109, five companions went in
search of the sixth, whose life-index tree had withered. One found him
buried under a rock; the second, a smith&rsquo;s son, broke it and took
out the body; the third, a doctor&rsquo;s son, made a potion which
caused it to revive. The five then helped the man to recover his wife,
who had been abducted by a Khan, and each one claimed her as his
reward. In their struggle for her she was torn in pieces.</p>
<p>In the same work, p. 299, four youths, working in turn, made a girl
out of wood and gave her a soul; each one claimed her. The decision was
that she belonged to the fourth, who gave the figure life.</p>
<p>In this work, p. 277, it is stated that Prince Vikram&#257;ditya
learnt from robber bands the art of robbery, and from fraudulent
dealers to lie.</p>
<p>In A. von Schiefner&rsquo;s <i>Tibetan Tales</i> (Ralston), p. 93,
Prince Abhaya, son of Bimbisara, King of Magadha, is stated to have
learnt coach-making; another son, J&#299;vaka, became a celebrated
doctor. A full account of him is given in <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents
Contes et Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol. iii, p. 331ff. Sir R. Burton
stated that, according to ancient Mohammedan practice, all rulers
should learn a handicraft. (<i>Arabian Nights</i>, Lady Burton&rsquo;s
ed., vol. i, p. 339, note).</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i> (Knowles), 2nd ed., p. 110, a Prince
who had been trained by an expert robber stole the egg from under a
hawk while it sat on its nest, without disturbing the bird.</p>
<p>There are West African variants of the Sinhalese tale. One from the
coast provinces on the north side of the Congo is given in <i>Notes on
the Folklore of the Fjort</i> (Dennett), p. 33. A hunter who had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>three wives was killed while hunting. The first
wife dreamt of this, the second guided the others to the spot, the
third collected simples and revived him. When they quarrelled regarding
the one to whom his life was due, and it was settled that the one whose
food he ate first should be considered his preserver, he ate the food
of the third wife, and the majority of the people approved of his
decision.</p>
<p>In the same work, p. 74, the beautiful daughter of Nzambi, the Earth
Goddess, could only be won by an earthly being who could bring down the
heavenly fire. The spider went to fetch it, assisted by the tortoise,
rat, woodpecker, and sandfly. Each of the animals afterwards claimed
the girl, and in the end, Nzambi, as she could not give her to all,
paid each one her value, and the girl remained unwed.</p>
<p>A variant of the Sierra Leone district is given in <i>Cunnie Rabbit,
Mr. Spider, and the Other Beef</i> (Cronise and Ward), p. 200. A man
who had four young sons was killed while hunting. The sons heard the
story from their mother when they were full grown, and went in search
of him. The eldest found his gun and bones, the second collected and
joined them, the third re-made the body with mud, the youngest blew up
the nose through a charmed horn, and he became alive. The narrator
stated that it has been impossible to decide to whom of the three his
restoration to life was due. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there were a Gamar&#257;la and
Gama-mahag&#275; (his wife). There were seven daughters of the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s; there was no male child. Taking another male
child, they reared him for themselves. This child was very thoroughly
doing the work at the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Thereafter, after he became big, they asked at the hand of the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughters, &ldquo;Who is willing to marry this
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All [the elder ones] said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want that scabby
filthy one,&rdquo; but there was willingness [on the part] of the last
young one. The two persons having married, the other six began to treat
this young one harshly, but she did not take to heart (<i>lit.</i>,
mind) the things they are saying.</p>
<p>While they are thus, the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s son-in-law went to a
smithy to get a digging hoe made. He said to the smith,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Make and give me a digging hoe.&rdquo; Although the
smith took no notice of it, yet for many days he went again and again.
He did not make and give the digging hoe.</p>
<p>One day, at the time when the smith was eating cooked rice, having
put into the heat a piece of iron refuse which this person had thrown
away, he began to blow the skins (bellows).</p>
<p>Then the figure of a great lion having come to the smith, he came
running, leaving the cooked rice and food, and when he looked, having
seen that very valuable iron is becoming hot, in an instant he made the
digging hoe and gave it. Thereafter, the smith said to the
Gamar&#257;la, &ldquo;This child is a very virtuous royal Prince. To
this one, without delay a kingdom is about to descend.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p>This boy again one day went to another man to ask for (borrow) a
yoke of oxen. When he went there the man said, &ldquo;I cannot to-day;
come to-morrow.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2676src" href=
"#xd27e2676" name="xd27e2676src">1</a> The man brought him there many
days. He did not give the yoke of oxen: &ldquo;There are no oxen with
me to give,&rdquo; [he said]. Well then, this one in sorrow came to his
house.</p>
<p>Although two [semi]-wild male buffaloes of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s
are staying on two hills, no one is able to catch them. Thereafter,
this one, taking a yoke and having gone to the rice field, performed an
Act of Truth.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2702src" href="#xd27e2702"
name="xd27e2702src">2</a> Having set up the yoke in the grass, he said,
&ldquo;The sovereignty will fall to me indeed. The wild one on that
hill and the wild one on this hill, to-morrow morning must have
presented [themselves] neck by neck to this yoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereafter, on the following day morning, he said to this
one&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;Taking a little food, come to the rice field;
I am going to plough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman said, &ldquo;Where have you cattle to plough?&rdquo;
Having said it, she laughed.</p>
<p>This one said, &ldquo;There will be a yoke of cattle for me in the
rice field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having gone to the field, when he looked, both the wild buffaloes
had come, presenting their necks to the yoke. Well then, this one
having tied the yoke began to plough. His wife having come to the rice
field taking the food, when she looked, saw that this one is ploughing.
Afterwards, having gone near the yoke, she said, &ldquo;There will be
much weariness; be good enough to eat a little food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereafter, having stopped the yoke of cattle, and gone to a shade
[after] washing off the mud, and having eaten the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>food,
through weariness he placed his head on the waist pocket of his wife a
little time, and went to sleep.</p>
<p>While he was sleeping there a little time a dream appeared: on the
yoke a hive of Bambar&#257; bees has been fastened. Then having awoke,
he said to the woman, &ldquo;An&#275;! Bolan, in a dream a hive of
Bambar&#257;s was fastened on the yoke; look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman laughed and said, &ldquo;If so, a kingdom will fall
to you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had been [sleeping] there again a little time, [he said],
&ldquo;An&#275;! Bolan, maggots<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2729src"
href="#xd27e2729" name="xd27e2729src">3</a> fell on the great toe of my
foot; look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, also, this woman laughed, and said, &ldquo;If so, you will
receive the sovereignty now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was there [asleep] a little time again, the clods (<i lang=
"si-latn">h&#299; kae&#7789;a</i>) which this one ploughed up appear to
be of silver colour. Again he said to the woman, &ldquo;The plough
clods are silver colour; look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, also, this woman laughed, and said, &ldquo;If so, you will
receive the sovereignty immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, when he had been sleeping, he said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Bolan, I
hear a great noise; look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, also, this woman having laughed, says, &ldquo;Fetching you
to go, they are coming to appoint you to the sovereignty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, when he had been sleeping, he said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Bolan, I
hear the noise very near this; look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This woman says, &ldquo;An&#275;! There is nothing to be seen. On
account of the three worlds<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2751src" href=
"#xd27e2751" name="xd27e2751src">4</a> that you ploughed your head is
made crazy. Be good enough to sleep a little time without
speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a little time had gone again, she awoke him: &ldquo;The sound
of the five kinds of tom-toms,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2756src"
href="#xd27e2756" name="xd27e2756src">5</a> and the decorated tusk
elephant are coming. Be pleased to arise quickly.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>Just as this one was awaking, the tusk elephant having come, kneeled
down.</p>
<p>Thereafter, having caused this one to bathe in scented sandal-wood
water, having put on him the royal ornaments, and having put in that
very manner the ornaments on his wife also, they placed both of them on
the back of the tusk elephant.</p>
<p>As they were going, he caused the smith to be brought, and impaled
him. Having caused the person who did not give the yoke of buffaloes to
be brought, he heated cow-dung, and having held both his lips to both
sides, he poured it down his throat.</p>
<p>As he was going near the house of the Gamar&#257;la, the King said,
for the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughters to hear:&mdash;</p>

instruments, (2) wind instruments, (3) stringed instruments, (4) metal
instruments, (5) the throats of animals. In <i>The Indian

<h2 class="main">How the Poor Prince became King</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there was a Prince, [the son] of
a poor King, it is said. The Prince went to another country to learn
letters. Having gone there, and in no time learning his letters, he
said to the teacher, &ldquo;I must go to my village.&rdquo; Afterwards
the teacher gave him permission.</p>
<p>After that, while the Prince was coming to the city, the Prince
having become hungry, remained sleeping near a tree. A man having come
there said, &ldquo;What, Prince, art thou sleeping there for? It is not
good to sleep there; [be pleased] to get up,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;I cannot even get up. I am hungry;
because of it, indeed, I have fallen down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man says, &ldquo;Well, then, what shall I do? In my hand
also there is not a thing to give for food. There is an
A&#7789;&#7789;ikk&#257; tree<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2880src" href=
"#xd27e2880" name="xd27e2880src">1</a>; on that
A&#7789;&#7789;ikk&#257; tree the fruit will be ripe. Let us go [for
me] to show it to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Causing the Prince to arise, and having come near the
A&#7789;&#7789;ikk&#257; tree, that very man, having plucked
A&#7789;&#7789;ikk&#257; and given it to the Prince, after he ate said
to the Prince, &ldquo;Now then, go you along that path. Well, I&rsquo;m
going;&rdquo; and the man went away.</p>
<p>After that, as the Prince also was coming along the path he met with
a leopard [standing] across the path. The Prince cannot come [on
account of it]. Well then, while the Prince is there a man is coming
along in the direction in which the Prince is. Then, as the man would
drive this leopard to the Prince, he shouted, and said
&ldquo;H&#363;,&rdquo; and clapped his hands. Then the leopard bounded
off and went away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51"
name="pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>Afterwards that man having come near the Prince, asked,
&ldquo;Prince, where art thou going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince says, &ldquo;Having gone in this manner to learn letters,
I am going to my city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man says, &ldquo;Going to the city does not matter to you.
Come, to go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince says, &ldquo;How shall I go in that way? My parents will
seek me. Because of it, having gone to the city, and asked at the hand
of my parents I will come,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the man said, &ldquo;I will be of the assistance that parents
are of. You come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Prince went with the man. Having gone, they went to a
city. Staying at a resting-place at the city, and doing hired work in
the city, the two persons are getting their living.</p>
<p>When they were there no long time, one day the man said to the
Prince, &ldquo;Child, I cannot work in this manner. You go and seeking
[materials] for food, come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Prince from the following day went [alone] for hired
work, and [after] finding [and doing] it, returned. In that way for not
many days he is getting a living.</p>
<p>One day, a King and soldiers came to that city from another country
to fight the King of that country, and surrounded the city. After that,
the King told the Ministers to go to the battle. The King did not go to
the battle. Afterwards the Ministers prepared to go to the battle,
taking weapons and implements.</p>
<p>Then this Prince said to that man, &ldquo;Grandfather, I also must
go to the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Child, what battle [is there]
for us! We poor men, can we go to fight with a King? You remain silent,
doing nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;No, grandfather, I can fight very
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man still said &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Then the Prince says,
&ldquo;Grandfather, however much you should say
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; I am indeed going.&rdquo; Having said [this]
the Prince went when the Ministers were going. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having gone there and waited for the fight, when on both sides they
were making ready, this Prince said at the hand of the Ministers,
&ldquo;Give<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2921src" href="#xd27e2921" name=
"xd27e2921src">2</a> me a weapon from those which you brought, for me
to remain for the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Ministers say, &ldquo;What fighting dost thou know? Do thou
be silent, doing nothing.&rdquo; Having said it, they scolded the
Prince. After that, the Prince having bounded to one side, remained
doing nothing.</p>
<p>Then, having begun the battle, they were fighting; on this side many
Ministers were cut down. [After] cutting them down, this side is coming
to lose. The Prince having seen it, taking a weapon of that dead
Minister&rsquo;s, fought and cut down the King and army of that side;
and this side having conquered, the Ministers and the remaining people
and this Prince came to the city.</p>
<p>The Ministers having come to the royal palace, said to the King,
&ldquo;Many of our army died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King asked, &ldquo;If so, owing to whom did you win in this
battle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ministers said, &ldquo;A youngster went with us. It is owing to
the youngster, indeed, that we conquered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the King asked, &ldquo;Where is the boy?&rdquo; As the
Prince was here he went before the King. The King asked, &ldquo;From
what country camest thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I am a stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King asked, &ldquo;What dost thou want done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I will take anything I receive.&rdquo; After
that the King gave him villages, gave goods.</p>
<p>After that, staying in these villages, that man and the Prince, both
of them, were obtaining a livelihood from the goods. At the time when
they were [there], the King had become very aged. While he was thus the
King died.</p>
<p>For the King there was neither a Prince nor anyone. Because of it,
at the time when the Ministers, decorating the tusk elephant, are going
in the four streets with the sound of the five musical instruments, the
tusk elephant, having gone to the house at which are that Prince and
the man, kneeled near that Prince. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53"
href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having been [there] at the time when it was kneeling, the Ministers,
causing the Prince to bathe in scented water, and placing the Prince on
the tusk elephant, came to the royal palace, [and he became King].</p>
<p>Until the end of the Prince&rsquo;s life he remained exercising the
sovereignty. The man who stayed with the Prince having become the
Minister to the King, stayed in the palace itself.</p>

began to plant the garden; he set various kinds [of plants] in the
garden. After that, the King went to look at the garden; he saw that
there were various kinds of sugar-cane, sweet oranges, mandarin
oranges, in the garden. The King said to the gardener that he must look
well after the garden.</p>
<p>In that way, after not many days, the King said to the gardener,
&ldquo;Take bows and arrows; should thieves come, shoot them.&rdquo;
Thereupon, by the authority of the King, he was thinking of shooting
should they come in from outside.</p>
<p>Not many days after that, the King said to the Adik&#257;rama
(Minister), &ldquo;Let us go to the garden [secretly] to look into the
examination [of it made] by the gardener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Adik&#257;rama said, &ldquo;The order made by Your Honour
is [that he is] to shoot thieves. It is not good for us to
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;That man by this time is asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the King and the Adik&#257;rama, after the foolish King
had taken off the royal ornaments, that very night, taking the disguise
of thieves, went to the garden. Having gone, they began to pluck
oranges.</p>
<p>Then the gardener awoke. The man, taking his bow, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>having
come, shot at the King; when he shot him (<i lang=
"si-latn">widapuh&#257;ma</i>) the King died.</p>
<p>After that, the Adik&#257;rama and the gardener spoke together,
&ldquo;What shall we do about this?&rdquo; Speaking [further] the
Adik&#257;rama said, &ldquo;The things that are to happen
happened.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2995src" href="#xd27e2995"
name="xd27e2995src">1</a> Having said [this], the Adik&#257;rama having
told the gardener to cut a hole, when he cut it they buried the
King.</p>
<p>After that, the Adik&#257;rama said to the gardener, &ldquo;Come,
and go to the palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two persons having gone to the palace, and [the Minister] having
decorated the gardener with the royal insignia (<i lang=
"si-latn"><span class="corr" id="xd27e3006" title=

"xd27e3009src" href="#xd27e3009" name="xd27e3009src">2</a> The
Adik&#257;rama does not make obeisance.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter the King thought he must tell him a parable.
Having thought so, and having called the Adik&#257;rama, he said,
&ldquo;In the midst of the forest there are many kinds of trees. Having
cut a tree of good race out of them, and shaved [the bark off] it, and
planed it, and done carving work, they take it as a log for a
travellers&rsquo; shed (<i lang="si-latn">ambalama</i>). Taking it
[there], after they have built the travellers&rsquo; shed, do both
persons possessing lineage and persons of no lineage stay in the
travellers&rsquo; shed?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3018src"
href="#xd27e3018" name="xd27e3018src">3</a> he asked.</p>
<p>When he asked, the Adik&#257;rama said, &ldquo;All persons stay in
the travellers&rsquo; shed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King said, &ldquo;[There is] service for persons
possessing the Adik&#257;rama lineage, service for persons of no
lineage, service for [all in] the world.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3025src" href="#xd27e3025" name="xd27e3025src">4</a></p>
<p>After that, the Adik&#257;rama from that day made obeisance to the
King. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=

<p>Well then, the King remained exercising the sovereignty quite
virtuously (<i lang="si-latn">hondinma</i>), without injustice.</p>

According to it, the King visited the garden alone, pretending to steal
Kaekiri fruits, and was shot by the gardener. When he was dead the
gardener reported the matter to the Adik&#257;r, who got the King
buried secretly, and proclaimed the gardener King. Some poor people
whose lands the Adik&#257;r had seized complained to the new King, who
held an enquiry, and gave judgment in their favour, remarking,

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there was a Gamar&#257;la, it is
said. There was a daughter of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s. Bringing a
son-in-law for the daughter, when he was there for many days the men of
the village spoke of going to Puttalam.</p>
<p>Then this Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s son-in-law said to the
Gamar&#257;la, &ldquo;Father-in-law, I also must go to Puttalam.&rdquo;
The Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;It is good, son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the whole of them obtaining occupation in loading sacks,
the son-in-law went on the journey, and the Gamar&#257;la remained [at
home].</p>
<p>The son-in-law, setting off for the journey, at the time when he was
going along driving thirty [pack] bulls, met with a company of men
going [after] placing sacks on twelve horses.</p>
<p>After he met with them this man said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Friends,
taking my thirty bulls, give me (<i lang="si-latn">dilall&#257;</i>)
those few horses.&rdquo; Then the men said, &ldquo;It is
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man having given the thirty bulls, at the time when he was
going along taking the twelve horses, he met with yet a company of men
who were going taking two elephants.</p>
<p>After that, this man said, &ldquo;Friends, taking my twelve horses,
will you give me those two elephants?&rdquo; The men said, &ldquo;It is
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this man, having given the twelve horses, at the time when he
was going along taking the two elephants, he met with yet some men who
were going hunting, taking twelve dogs.</p>
<p>Then this man asked, &ldquo;Friends, taking my two elephants,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>will you give me those twelve dogs?&rdquo; The men
said, &ldquo;It is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, this man having given the two elephants, at the time
when he was going on taking the twelve dogs he met with a company of
potters, taking some pingo (carrying-stick) loads of pots.</p>
<p>Then the man asked, &ldquo;From these twelve dogs taking six, will
you give me for cooking in order to eat, a small cooking pot and a
large cooking pot?&rdquo; The men said, &ldquo;It is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the man having given six dogs, taking a small cooking
pot and a large cooking pot he went hunting with the other six
dogs.</p>
<p>Having gone into the jungle, and prepared a hearth near an ant-hill,
in order, after having cooked, to eat cooked rice, at the time when he
was breaking fire-wood a cobra that was in that ant-hill came and bit
the man. Then the man swooned owing to the poison&rsquo;s having fallen
there.</p>
<p>At the time when a Vaedd&#257; of another distant place came walking
[there] while hunting, he saw that there are six dogs; and having seen
that there is a hearth, said, &ldquo;Why are these six dogs here, and a
hearth, without a man?&rdquo; While he was seeking and looking about,
he saw that the man had fallen down. Having seen him, and lifted him
up, when he looked [at him] the man was [as though] dead.</p>
<p>After that, the Vaedd&#257; having said, &ldquo;What is this man
dead for?&rdquo; When he looked [after] going near the body, there was
a wound, and the Vaedd&#257; perceived that a snake had bitten him.
Ascertaining it, after he had applied medicine the man got up.</p>
<p>Then the Vaedd&#257; asked, &ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man said, &ldquo;The journey I came on is thus; the things that
happened to me are thus. Having come hunting, and prepared the hearth,
in order, after I had cooked here, to eat, when I was breaking firewood
a cobra bit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vaedd&#257; said, &ldquo;Come away, and go with me.&rdquo; This
man having said, &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; the six dogs and the man went
with the Vaedd&#257; to the Vaedd&#257;&rsquo;s city. Having gone
there, that day the Vaedd&#257; gave him food. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>During the time while the man was there, that very day night the
King of the city died. On the following day morning, there being no
person for the sovereignty, [after] decorating the tusk elephant the
Ministers went [with it] to seek a King.</p>
<p>At the time when they were going, this tusk elephant was going along
looking at the Vaedd&#257;&rsquo;s house. As it was going, that man
whom the cobra bit was lying down in the Vaedd&#257;&rsquo;s veranda.
The tusk elephant went and knelt near the man.</p>
<p>After that, the Ministers, having told this man to get up, when he
arose bathed him with perfumed water, and having decorated him with the
royal crown, placing him on the back of the tusk elephant went to the
palace.</p>
<p>After he went there, the King caused the Vaedd&#257; to be brought,
and said, &ldquo;Owing to you, indeed, I attained to such exalted
things.&rdquo; Having said, &ldquo;Because of it, receive the post of
Adik&#257;rama (Minister),&rdquo; he appointed the office of
Adik&#257;rama to the Vaedd&#257;.</p>
<p>Having given him it, he remained up to the end of his life
exercising the sovereignty with the ten [royal] virtues.</p>

<p class="first">In a certain country there are a woman and a man, it
is said. There are two daughters of the two persons. They gave one
daughter [in marriage]. The man at the place where they gave the
daughter had suitable things.</p>
<p>A very rich man having come, asked the other daughter [in marriage].
Then the girl&rsquo;s father said, &ldquo;I will not give her to you;
the lineage (<i lang="si-latn">wan&#805;s&#275;</i>) of your people is
not good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that another man came and asked. The man had nothing; his
lineage alone was good. The girl&rsquo;s mind was to go to the man who
formerly came and asked, [but she was given to the second one].</p>
<p>Well then, when the girl [after her marriage] is without
[sufficient] to eat and to wear, one day the girl&rsquo;s father went
to see the girl. Afterwards, having given the man sitting
accommodation,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3127src" href="#xd27e3127"
name="xd27e3127src">1</a> and got the fire together, and put a potsherd
on the hearth, she put tamarind seeds in the potsherd, and they began
to fry, making a sound, &ldquo;K&#257;s, k&#257;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl&rsquo;s father says, &ldquo;What, daughter, are you
frying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl said, &ldquo;Father, I am frying our lineage, [the only
thing we possess].&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, anger having come to the man, he got up, and came to his
village. Having come there, on the following day, he went to the place
where the other daughter is.</p>
<p>When he went there, the daughter, having cooked the sweetmeats
called Wellawaehun for the father, gave him to eat. He had not eaten
them since he was born.</p>
<p>That day, having eaten, when he was coming to his village
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>saying and saying, &ldquo;Wellawaehun,
Wellawaehun,&rdquo; in order not to forget the name of them, his foot
struck a stone that was on the path.</p>
<p>Then the man was caused to exclaim
&ldquo;Hobbanc&#333;&#7693;i&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3145src"
href="#xd27e3145" name="xd27e3145src">2</a>; &ldquo;Wellawaehun&rdquo;
was forgotten. From there until the time when he comes to his village,
having come saying and saying &ldquo;Hobbanc&#333;&#7693;i,
Hobbanc&#333;&#7693;i,&rdquo; he says to his wife, &ldquo;Bolan, to-day
in our girl&rsquo;s quarter I ate Hobbanc&#333;&#7693;i. The taste is
very good; you cook them, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the woman says, &ldquo;An&#275;! I have not even heard of
them since I was born, so how shall I cook them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man, saying and saying, &ldquo;What, Bola! Strumpet! Do you
say you don&rsquo;t know? I ate them now, and came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the two old people are quarrelling about this, men of the
village having come, a man said, &ldquo;She indeed is doing all this,
bringing her mouth like a Wellawaehun roll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! I [meant to] say those indeed,&rdquo; the man
said.</p>
<p>After that, they two, having joined together, cooked five
Wellawaehun rolls. Thereupon the man said, &ldquo;There are three for
me, two for you.&rdquo; The woman, too, said, &ldquo;There are three
for me, two for you.&rdquo; They two being unable to divide these, made
an agreement, that is, &ldquo;Let us two remain without speaking. For
the person who speaks first there are two,&rdquo; they agreed.</p>
<p>Being satisfied with it, having shut the door, they lay down. While
they are lying down thus, perceiving that there was not any sound of
them, the men of the village came, and having spoken to the door,
finding that there was no sound they said, &ldquo;These will have
died.&rdquo; Having split open the door and gone into the house, at the
time when they looked they remained as though dead.</p>
<p>After that, in order to carry them to bury, men tied their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>hands and feet. The man, while they are tying his
feet, having got hurt, said, &ldquo;Uwah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the woman said, &ldquo;There are two for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scolding and scolding these two persons for their act, the men went
away.</p>

<p class="first">In The <i>Orientalist</i>, vol. i, p. 237, Mr. H.
White mentioned that a story about the frying of the family honour is
contained in a work called <i lang=
"sa-latn">At&#299;ta-v&#257;kya-d&#299;paniya</i>. In that instance
apparently the pan which was placed on the fire was empty.</p>
<p>In the same Journal, vol. i, p. 136, a variant of the latter part of
the tale is given by Miss S. J. Goonetilleke. Twenty-five idiots were
employed by a Gamar&#257;la, and it was their duty to provide plantain
leaf plates for the other servants and themselves. One day they decided
that they gave themselves unnecessary trouble in doing work which a
single person could perform, so it was settled that all should sleep,
and that the man who first opened his eyes or uttered a sound should
cut all the leaves. When the leaves were not forthcoming at the
meal-time the Gamar&#257;la and his men went in search of the idiots,
and being unable to arouse them, thought they were dead and dug a grave
for them. One after another they were thrown into it in silence, but as
they were being covered with earth a digging tool struck one on the
leg, causing him to utter an involuntary groan. The others instantly
arose and told him that henceforth he must provide all the leaf
plates.</p>
<p>In the stories appended to the <i>Pantcha-Tantra</i> of the
Abb&eacute; Dubois, a man at night disputed with his wife as to whether
men or women are the greater chatterboxes, and each wagered a betel
leaf that the other would speak first. As they did not appear next day,
the door of their apartment was broken open, and the two were found
sitting up but deprived of speech. It was concluded that they were
suffering from some inimical magic, for which a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a
recommended the application of heated gold to their bodies. The man was
burnt on his sole, above the knees, at both elbows, on the stomach, and
on the crown of the head, and bore it in silence; but when the woman
was burnt on the sole she cried, &ldquo;App&#257;! That is
enough,&rdquo; and handed her husband the betel leaf.</p>
<p>In <i>Folklore in Southern India</i> (Pandit Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a
S&#257;str&#299;), p. 277, (<i>Tales of the Sun</i>, p. 280), a beggar
and his wife who had been at a feast at which they ate muffins
(<i lang="si-latn">t&#333;&#347;ei</i>), cooked five muffins, and
agreed that whoever opened an eye or spoke first should have only
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>two of them. They then bolted the door and lay
down. After three days the villagers entered by the roof and saw that
the couple were apparently dead. They were carried to the cremation
ground, placed on two pyres which were raised, and lights were applied.
When the fire reached the man&rsquo;s leg a voice came from his pyre,
&ldquo;I shall be satisfied with two muffins.&rdquo; From the other
pyre a voice replied, &ldquo;I have gained the day; let me have the
three.&rdquo; When the villagers heard the story, it was decided that,
having apparently died and been on the funeral pyre, they could not
return to the village or it would perish, so a separate hut was built
for them.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i> (Swynnerton), p. 14, a
farmer and his wife who disputed regarding the shutting of the door,
agreed that it should be closed by the one who spoke first. After a
wild dog had eaten their food, the barber called, shaved the
man&rsquo;s head and half his beard and moustache, and blackened him
with lamp-black. When the wife, who had gone out, returned and asked
what he had been doing, she was told that it was she who must close the
door.</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol.
ii, p. 209, a man and his wife made three cakes; each ate one, and they
agreed that the first who spoke should allow the other to eat the third
cake. Robbers broke in, began to collect all the goods in the house,
and at last seized the wife. The man still did not utter a word; when
the woman cried out and scolded him, he said, &ldquo;Wife, it is
certainly I who have gained the cake.&rdquo; <span class=

<p class="first">In a country a man near the [New] Year spoke to the
people of the village: &ldquo;To bring palm sugar let us go to the
quarter where there is palm sugar.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; a
few people said. Having said &ldquo;I am going to-morrow,&rdquo; and
having plucked fifty coconuts and removed the husks, he placed them in
the corner in the house.</p>
<p>On the following day morning, bringing the pingo stick and two sacks
outside, and having broken [open] the sacks, and placed them below the
raised veranda, when he was going into the house to bring the coconuts
[his] wife said, &ldquo;Stop and eat cooked rice. Be good enough to tie
the pingo load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;If so, give me the cooked rice at the raised
veranda,&rdquo; at the time when he was eating the cooked rice his
relatives brought a coconut apiece; when they said, &ldquo;Bring and
give each of us also a packet of palm sugar,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;Put them into those sacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subsequently, having eaten cooked rice and arisen, at the time when,
having lifted the two sacks, he looked at them, there were collected
together [in them coconuts] to the extent that he can carry.
Subsequently, taking from his house, for expenses [on the journey],
rice and two coconuts, having put them in a sack he tied up the pingo
load. Afterwards, having called up the people who are going [with him],
taking the pingo load he set off and went.</p>
<p>Having gone many <i lang="si-latn">gawwu</i> (each of four miles) in
number, [after] exchanging [the coconuts for] palm sugar, he came back
to the village. On the following day morning, having summoned the
people of the village who gave the coconuts, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>and
looked at the account according to the manner in which they gave the
coconuts, he apportioned and gave [the packets of palm sugar] to
them.</p>
<p>Subsequently, at the time when he looked in the sack there was
[left] one packet of palm sugar. When he inquired about it and looked,
he perceived that it was exchanged for one out of the two coconuts that
he carried for expenses.</p>
<p>Afterwards having gone into the house, when he looked [there] having
seen that there was [still] in the corner the heap of coconuts which he
had husked for carrying, [and that he had taken only his
relatives&rsquo; coconuts, and left his own at home], he said,
&ldquo;Apoyi! What is the thing that has happened to me!&rdquo; and
struck blows on his breast.</p>
<p>Then his wife got to quarrelling with him. Unable [to bear] the
worry, having gone running to the pansala that was near he told the
Lord (monk) the whole of these matters that occurred.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A Br&#257;hma&#7751;a having told some men to come
from a certain city, and having praised the robes which the King of the
city is wearing, this Br&#257;hma&#7751;a made seven stanzas, and gave
them to those seven men. Those very seven men having taken the seven
stanzas and gone, employed yet [another] Br&#257;hma&#7751;a and got
them explained. Should you say, &ldquo;How was the meaning?&rdquo; it
was praise of the copper [coloured] silk robe which the King of that
city is wearing.</p>
<p>After they got this meaning explained, these seven men spoke
together, &ldquo;Let us make up a trick at this place.&rdquo; Speaking
[thus] together, they arrived at a city at which there is a foolish
King.</p>
<p>Arriving [there], they spoke to the King of the city:
&ldquo;Maharaja, what a robe that is which Your Majesty is wearing! We
have woven a copper [coloured] silk robe for the King of our city, and
given it. It is like the thin silk robes obtained from the divine
world. Having looked in the direction of that King, when we looked in
your direction you appear like a servant who is near that King,&rdquo;
these seven men said.</p>
<p>While hearing this word, shame was produced in the King. Having been
produced, he thought to himself, &ldquo;While I also am a King, what is
it to me!&rdquo; Thinking, &ldquo;Cannot I cause those silk robes to be
woven?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;For [weaving] the silk robes what sort
of other things are necessary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the seven men say regarding it, &ldquo;Having obtained silk
thread from good silk yarn (<i>lit.</i>, thread), be good enough
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>to give us it. Having constructed a place in your
auspicious<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3300src" href="#xd27e3300" name=
"xd27e3300src">2</a> Sal [trees] garden, you must give us it. You must
bring to that place and give us food and drink,&rdquo; they said to the
King. Having said it, they said at the very time, &ldquo;The silk cloth
that we weave is not visible to a base-born person. Should he be a
well-born (<i lang="si-latn">saha-j&#257;taka</i>) person it is visible
to him,&rdquo; they said to the King.</p>
<p>At that time the King having procured silk thread to his mind gave
it. The men having taken it to the auspicious Sal garden, and the party
putting the thread away, when people come to look at the copper
[coloured] silk robes these seven men run there and here in the
auspicious Sal<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3310src" href="#xd27e3310"
name="xd27e3310src">3</a> garden. The silk robe is not visible; only
according to the manner in which these seven persons are running the
extent [of it] is visible. Thereupon the men think in their minds,
&ldquo;Because we are base-born this copper [coloured] silk robe is not
visible to us.&rdquo; What of their thinking so! Except that each
separate person thinks it for himself, no one speaks it.</p>
<p>The King sent a messenger for the purpose of looking whether, having
woven the robes, they are finished. Having seen that, except that after
tying the hand-lines (<i lang="si-latn">at-wael</i>) they are causing
[their arms] to row (<i lang="si-latn">paddanaw&#257;</i>),<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3322src" href="#xd27e3322" name="xd27e3322src">4</a>
the robe is not visible, [he thought], &ldquo;Should I say that I do
not perceive the robe they will say I am the son of a courtesan.&rdquo;
Because of shame at it, the messenger having gone to the royal house,
said, &ldquo;The gang of them having assembled together are weaving a
priceless robe. His<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3325src" href=
"#xd27e3325" name="xd27e3325src">5</a> work is not finished. Having
completed the work they will dress Your Honour in the robe,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>On account of the statement of the messenger, many persons went to
look at the robe, but except that they were causing [their arms] to
row, the robe was not visible to anyone. The whole of the retinue who
came, through fear that they will say they are illegitimate persons,
without seeing the robe having said and said, &ldquo;We perceive it. It
is indeed a very costly robe,&rdquo; went away.</p>
<p>Having woven for seven days, after the seven days&rsquo; date
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>which they got to finish in had elapsed, the King
went to look at the silk robe. Having gone, when he looked it was not
visible to the King also. What of its not [being visible]! He does not
tell anyone the word of its not being visible.</p>
<p>After that, those men having come, said to the King, &ldquo;Having
woven the copper [coloured] silk robe, it is finished. For you, Sir,
with our [own] hands we must robe you in it,&rdquo; they said.
&ldquo;Having got out all the clothes which there are, descended from
seven ancestors in succession, you must dress. Having dressed, you must
give us all those clothes,&rdquo; they said to the King.</p>
<p>The King, having heard the word, taking out all the royal
vestments<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3339src" href="#xd27e3339" name=
"xd27e3339src">6</a> that were of the time of his ancestors, and having
adorned himself in a good manner, and driven away everybody, gave the
party these clothes and all the other clothes that there were.</p>
<p>After he gave them, all the seven men having surrounded him and said
that they are putting on the King the copper [coloured] silk dress,
began to stroke his body everywhere. They began to stroke the head,
having said that they were putting on the crown. They stroked the arms,
having said that they were putting on the jacket. In that way having
stroked all parts of the body, and having said that they had dressed
him, they caused them to bring the King into the middle of the great
retinue, and said thus to the citizens: &ldquo;Neither His Majesty our
King nor any person of the retinue dwelling in this city in the olden
time before this, either put on a robe in this manner, or saw one.
Because of that, the whole of you, [after our] dressing His Majesty the
King in this robe, causing His Majesty the King to sit on the festival
tusk elephant, and having caused him to perambulate towards the right
through all places in the city, again conduct him to the royal
house.&rdquo; Having said this, they brought the tusk elephant, and
caused the King to sit on the tusk elephant naked; and they began to go
in procession to all places of the city.</p>
<p>These men, taking [the contents of] this house of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>royal
insignia (<i lang=
"si-latn">r&#257;jab&#257;n&#7693;&#257;g&#257;r&#275;</i>), and having
acted deceitfully, and said that they had woven the copper [coloured]
silk robe,&mdash;because they got [the contents of] the house of the
royal insignia when they were going, established for the city the name
&ldquo;[City] of T&#257;mbraparnni Island,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3356src" href="#xd27e3356" name="xd27e3356src">7</a> and went

<p class="first">In <i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i>
(Swynnerton), p. 60, a girl who had promised to prove that the King
sometimes lied, invited the King to visit a palace she had built, and
to see God there, but stated he was visible only to one person at a
time, and only if he was of legitimate birth. The two Ministers first
entered successively, saw nothing, and declared that they had seen God
inside. The King then entered, and on coming out insisted that he also
had seen God there. The girl then convicted him of telling a falsehood,
and as usual in folk-tales was married by the King.</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Les Avad&#257;nas</i> (Julien), No. xxxix, vol. i,
p. 150, there is a story of a fool who handed some cotton to a spinner,
and begged him to make it into extremely fine thread. The man did so,
but the fool thought it too coarse. The spinner became angry, and
pointing to the air with his finger, said, &ldquo;There are extremely
fine threads.&rdquo; When the man asked how it was he could not see
them, the spinner replied it was because of their extreme thinness,
which was such that even the best workmen could not see them, much less
a stranger. The fool gave him a fresh order, and paid him handsomely.

<h2 class="main">The Foolish Youth</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a woman and a man and a
youth (their son), it is said.</p>
<p>While they were there, the woman having given eight panams<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3386src" href="#xd27e3386" name="xd27e3386src">1</a>
to the youth said, &ldquo;Son, take these eight panams to the shop and
bring two plates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the youth taking the eight panams to the shop said to
the trader, &ldquo;Mudal&#257;li, give me two plates.&rdquo; The
trader, taking two plates, gave them to the youth.</p>
<p>The youth said, &ldquo;How is the price for these plates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the trader said, &ldquo;For one plate it is seven tuttu
(quarter pa&#7751;ams); for two plates give me fourteen tuttu (= three
and a half pa&#7751;ams).</p>
<p>After that, the youth says, &ldquo;Mudal&#257;li, are you trying to
cheat me? You cannot cheat me. I will not give fourteen tuttu; also I
did not bring fourteen tuttu. Mother gave me eight panams.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3397src" href="#xd27e3397" name="xd27e3397src">2</a>
For the eight panams she told me to get two plates. If you will give
them for the eight panams, give me two plates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, and given the eight panams to the trader, while he
was coming away, taking the two plates, he met with a gang of thieves.
Having met with them, they asked at the hand of the youth, &ldquo;Where
did you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the youth says, &ldquo;Having told me to go to the shop to
bring two plates, mother gave me eight panams. Taking them, and going
to the shop, I asked the price for plates. Well then, the man tried to
cheat me. For the two plates <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href=
"#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>he told me to give fourteen tuttu.
Also in my hand there were not fourteen tuttu; it was eight panams that
I took. Having given the eight panams I am taking home these two
plates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the men said, &ldquo;If so, don&rsquo;t you go home. We are
going to break [into] a house; come, and go for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the youth, having said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; went with
the thieves to break [into] the house. Having gone there and bored a
hole through the wall, the thieves said to the youth who went for
plates, &ldquo;Go inside the house and put out into the light both all
the things which you can lift and [the things] which you cannot lift.
We will take them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the youth, having crept into the house, put out all the
things which the youth could lift. Having put them out, the youth could
not lift the stone on which coconut was ground.</p>
<p>The man who owned the house was sleeping, placing his head on the
stone. The youth having shaken the man&rsquo;s body, awoke him.
&ldquo;Get up quickly. To take this stone outside I cannot lift it
alone. Take hold of this a little in order to get it out,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The man having awoke at once, and seized and tied the youth, caught
part of those men; part of them ran off.</p>
<p>The thieves who were caught, and the youth, and the man who owned
the house, all went for the trial. As they were going on the road, says
the youth, &ldquo;I am not a thief at all. Our mother gave me eight
panams to bring two plates from the shop. Having gone to the shop I
asked the price for plates. The man tried to cheat me; for two plates
he asked fourteen tuttu. I did not give them; also in my hand there
were not fourteen tuttu. I only gave eight panams, and taking the two
plates, as I was going away I met with these men. Then the men said to
me, &lsquo;Where did you go?&rsquo; they asked. &lsquo;I went to the
shop to get two plates,&rsquo; I said. Then the men said, &lsquo;If so,
don&rsquo;t go home. We are going to break [into] a house; you come
too.&rsquo; So I came. Having come there, the men bored a hole through
the wall, and said to me, &lsquo;Creep you into this. Put outside the
things you can lift and the things you can&rsquo;t.&rsquo; I afterwards
crept into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>the house, and put outside those I could lift. I
tried to lift the stone on which your head was placed while you were
sleeping. I couldn&rsquo;t lift it, so in order to get it out I awoke
you. Well then, so much is my fault; I am not a thief. Now then, if you
are going to put me in prison, put me in prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that the man said, &ldquo;I will not put you in prison; doing
the work that I tell you, you can stay with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy said, &ldquo;H&#257;. I will stay [with you].&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, having gone for the trial, and put the other thieves in
prison, the man came home with that youth. In that very way, doing the
work which the man told him, the youth remained a considerable
time.</p>
<p>One day the man said, &ldquo;Youth, let us go to cut a [branch for
a] plough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth said, &ldquo;H&#257;, let us go,&rdquo; and taking an axe,
the man and the youth went to the forest on the river bank.</p>
<p>Having gone there, the man said to the youth, &ldquo;Cut thou this
tree at the root.&rdquo; The youth cut the tree at the root. After he
had cut it, the plough of the tree was not good.</p>
<p>Afterwards having gone near another tree, when they looked at it
there was a good plough in [a branch of] the tree. When they cut the
plough it would fall in the river.</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;Having gone up this tree, cut thou that plough
which is to be seen.&rdquo; [He then left him].</p>
<p>Then the youth having gone up the tree, when he was cutting the root
(lower end) of the plough while sitting down [on the branch] at the top
(or outer end) of the plough, a certain Lord (Buddhist monk) came.</p>
<p>When the Lord looked up at the tree, having seen that the youth
sitting at the top of the plough was cutting at the root, he said,
&ldquo;Foolish youth! Why, while you are at the top, are you cutting at
the root? When it is cut at the root it will fall together with thee
also, will it not, into the river? Sitting at the root [end], chop
towards the top.&rdquo; Having said this the Lord went away.</p>
<p>The youth said, &ldquo;What does the Lord know about it? I shall cut
it this way.&rdquo; Having said this, as he was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>chopping
and chopping, the plough being cut at the root, the plough and the
youth and the axe fell into the water of the river.</p>
<p>Then the youth, having got up quickly, walked ashore, taking the axe
and the plough. He put down the plough, and taking the axe, ran along
the path on which the Lord went. Having run there he overtook the Lord.
Having joined him, he said, &ldquo;Lord, as you said that I should fall
into the river you must tell me the day when I shall die. If not, I
shall chop you with this axe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord, when he looked, thought that there was no means of saying
otherwise; on that account he said, &ldquo;On the day when a drop of
rain has fallen on the crown of thy head thou wilt die.&rdquo; The Lord
then went away.</p>
<p>After that, the youth, taking the plough, came with the man to the
man&rsquo;s house. Having come there, when he had been there a long
time, on a certain day a drop of rain fell on the crown of the
youth&rsquo;s head, and on that day he died. (The narrator did not know
how he died).</p>
<p>The details of his death are given in the following variant of the
latter part of this story:</p>
<p>The monk said, &ldquo;In such and such a year, in such and such a
month, on such and such a day, thou wilt die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that day until the time when this stated number of years and
number of months and number of days had gone, having been looking [into
the account], on the stated day, when it became light he said,
&ldquo;To-day, having cooked amply give thou me to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having eaten and finished, he said, &ldquo;I shall die
to-day&rdquo;; and having said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t anybody speak to
me,&rdquo; went into the house, and shutting the door lay down
(<i lang="si-latn">budiy&#257;-gatt&#257;</i>).</p>
<p>The men who stayed outside from morning until the time when it
became evening, remained looking out. There was not any sound from this
man. Afterwards they said, &ldquo;What are we keeping this dead man
for? Let us take him and carry him away,&rdquo; and having placed a
bamboo [ready], they tied [the bier] to it. Having tied it, they go
away, taking it.</p>
<p>Between the house and the burial ground there is a hill-rice
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>chena. Because there is no other path to go on,
taking him into the chena they hurried on (<i>lit.</i>, ran).</p>
<p>Then the men who watch the hill-rice chena having been there, said,
&ldquo;What is this, Bola, that you are taking the corpse through the
hill-rice chena?&rdquo; and they scolded them.</p>
<p>Then the dead man sat up and said, &ldquo;Except that I am dead, you
should see [what I would do to you],&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the men who took the corpse said, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! This
one is speaking!&rdquo; and dropped him. Having fallen upon a cut
[pointed] stump [it pierced him, and] the man died.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To carry a corpse through a chena is considered to be
a very inauspicious act, which might have an injurious effect upon the
crop. Even to carry through one the tools necessary for digging the
grave would meet with strong remonstrances. In one instance, some of my
labourers were refused a passage along the footpath in a village
because they carried pickaxes and digging hoes, thus appearing, as the
villagers objected, like persons who were going to dig a grave.</p>
<p>In <i>The Orientalist</i>, vol. i, p. 136, Miss S. J. Goonetilleke
related a story about twenty-five idiots, in which the death prediction
occurs. The monk stated that the idiot would die when the third drop of
dew fell on his back while he was sheltering under a gourd. The drops
fell when he was beneath a frame on which a gourd grew, waiting while
some robbers whom he had joined entered a house in order to commit
robbery. He bellowed out, &ldquo;I am dead, I am dead,&rdquo; and they
all ran away.</p>
<p>In vol. i, p. 121, the editor, the late Mr. W. Goonetilleke, gave
the Sinhalese story of the branch cutting, the monk&rsquo;s prediction
of the man&rsquo;s death when a drop of water fell on his head from the
roof, and his remarks when the bier carriers were scolded by the owner
of a garden through which they were about to pass.</p>
<p>He also added variants. In one found in an Indian work called
<i lang="sa-latn">Bhara&#7789;aka dv&#257;-trin&#805;sik&#257;</i>
(Thirty-two Tales of Mendicant Monks), a stupid monk called
Da&#7751;&#7693;aka went to cut a post, and sat on the branch while
chopping. Some passing travellers pointed out that when the branch
broke he would fall and die; when he fell he therefore believed he must
be dead, and lay still. The other monks came to carry him to the
cremation ground; but on the way the road bifurcated, and they
quarrelled as to which path should be followed. The supposed corpse
then sat up and said that when alive he always went by the left road.
Bystanders intervened and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=
"#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>pointed out that as he had spoken he
could not be dead, but Da&#7751;&#7693;aka insisted that he was really
dead, and it was only after a long argument that the monks were
convinced that he was alive.</p>
<p>Mr. Goonetilleke also gave a translation of a similar Turkish story
in <i lang="de">Meister Nasr Eddin&rsquo;s Schw&auml;nke und
R&auml;uber und Richter</i>, in which the man was told he would die
when his ass eructated the second time. He lay down, believing he was
dead. When the bier carriers were doubtful how they should pass a
mudhole, the corpse sat up and said that when alive he avoided the
place.</p>
<p>The editor also added Lithuanian, German, and Saxon variants, as
well as an English one related to him by the Rev. S. Langdon, in which,
however, the man broke his neck in falling from the tree.</p>
<p>In the South Indian account of the Guru Param&#257;rta and his
foolish disciples, annexed to the Abb&eacute; Dubois&rsquo;
<i>Pantcha-Tantra</i>, p. 305, one of the disciples was cutting a
branch when a Pur&#333;hita Br&#257;hma&#7751;a warned him that he
would fall when it broke. After falling he ran after the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a and inquired when the Guru would die. The answer
was that cold at the hinder-parts is a sign of death,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e3512src" href="#xd27e3512" name="xd27e3512src">3</a> a remark
to which the Guru&rsquo;s death eventually was due.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i> (Swynnerton), p. 89,
the warning was given to a weaver by a traveller, who afterwards stated
that the man&rsquo;s death would occur when his mouth bled. Some days
afterwards the weaver saw in a glass a bit of scarlet thread stuck
between his front teeth, concluded that it was blood, and lay down to
die, until a customer showed him what it really was.</p>
<p>In the same work, p. 139, there is a story of a foolish weaver who
went to steal with some thieves. When they told him to look for a
suitable pole for raising the thatch of a house, he woke up the people
who were sleeping outside, and asked them to lend him a pole for the
purpose. An outcry was raised, and the thieves decamped.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Fairy Tales</i> (M. Stokes), p. 30, the person who
warned a youth who was cutting a branch, said he would die when he
found a scarlet thread on his jacket. When a thread stuck on it in the
bazaar, he went off, dug a grave, and lay in it until he heard a
passer-by offer four pice to anyone who would carry his jar of gh&#299;
for him; he then jumped up and offered to carry it.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i> (Knowles), 2nd ed., p. 199, a stupid
boy who was sent by his mother to sell a piece of cloth for four
rupees, refused six rupees that were offered for it. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Story of the Seven Thieves</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there were seven thieves, it is
said. Among them one was a fool, or one who was learning robbery.</p>
<p>One day when these seven persons were going to break [into] a house,
while on the road they spoke to that robber who was learning, and said
thus: &ldquo;Only we six persons will go for breaking [into] the house;
you stay outside.&rdquo; Teaching him [this], and having gone [there],
and in that manner having made the man wait outside, those six persons
got inside the house for house-breaking.</p>
<p>Thereupon, while those six persons were delaying a little, a thought
having occurred to this foolish thief, &ldquo;I also must steal
something from this,&rdquo; having thought [thus], when he was going
passing his hand over the things that were there a large millet
[grinding] stone was caught [by him]. Because he was unable to get it
up quite alone, he spoke to a man who was sleeping on a raised veranda,
and said, &ldquo;&#332;yi! &#332;yi! Get up to lift this stone a
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon this man having said, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; when he
cried out the robber sprang off and ran away. The seven persons having
collected together at one spot, [the other six] having beaten and
scolded that foolish thief, gave him advice.</p>
<p>Again, also, one day having gone calling him for breaking [into] a
house, in the aforesaid very manner having made the man wait outside,
the six persons got inside the house for robbery. While this fool was
staying in the open, shaking and shaking a post under the stick frame
of an ash-pumpkin creeper (on which it grew), an ash-pumpkin fruit that
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>at the post having broken off, fell on his head.
Thereupon the fool, having become [frightened], began to cry out,
saying, &ldquo;They killed me!&rdquo; Thereafter, the house men having
awakened, when there was a disturbance the whole of the thieves sprang
off, and went running away.</p>
<p>When they collected together in one place, they thought thus,
&ldquo;With this fool we shall not succeed in committing robbery; it is
necessary to send this one for a few robberies alone.&rdquo; Having
thought [this], one day they spoke to the man, &ldquo;Beginning from
to-day, [after] stealing something for food for us, come back,&rdquo;
they said.</p>
<p>And he having gone to a house in which was one old woman, and having
found a little pulse (<i lang="si-latn">mun-ae&#7789;a</i>), thought,
&ldquo;I must fry this little and carry it away,&rdquo; and put it into
a broken pot. When frying it, when it was coming to be fried to a
certain extent, taking a spoon he put [some] of it in the mouth of the
old woman who was sleeping in the house, to look if it was fried.
Thereupon the woman, unable to bear the burning in her mouth, began to
cry out. While the men who were sleeping, having said, &ldquo;What is
this?&rdquo; were coming to look, the thief sprang off and ran
away.</p>
<p>Again, also, one day having spoken to the foolish robber,
&ldquo;Catching two fowls for us from this house, come back,&rdquo;
they sent him.</p>
<p>And the robber having gone there, while he was asking, &ldquo;[Am I]
to bring the black ones [or] to bring the red ones?&rdquo; the owners,
having said, &ldquo;Who is this who is taking the fowls?&rdquo; drove
him away. Thereupon the robber sprang off and ran away.</p>
<p>Again also, one day having seen that there are two clumps of
sugar-cane at a house, they said, &ldquo;Cutting two from that for food
for us, come away,&rdquo; and sent him.</p>
<p>And this one having gone there and seen that there are equal shares
of black and white sugar-canes, while he was asking, &ldquo;Which
sugar-cane of these shall I bring?&rdquo; just as before, the owners
having come and said, &ldquo;What are you cutting sugar-cane
for?&rdquo; drove him away.</p>
<p>While he was continuing to commit robberies in that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>manner
for not many days, one day having met with a Gamar&#257;la, when he was
asking, &ldquo;[Where] are you going?&rdquo; &ldquo;We are going for a
means of livelihood,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;If so, come; there is a <i lang=
"si-latn">niyara</i> chopping<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3576src" href=
"#xd27e3576" name="xd27e3576src">1</a> in my rice field,&rdquo; calling
them and having gone to the house and handed over the work to them, the
Gamar&#257;la set off, and having gone somewhere or other, in the
evening came to the house. Having seen that they also, having finished
with the work and come to the house, were [there], and having given
them food and drink, etc., and given a place to sleep in, and in the
morning also, after it became light, having given them food, he started
them off and sent them away. Thereafter, the Gamar&#257;la having gone
to the rice field, and when looking having seen that all the earthen
ridges had been cut and thrown down, arriving at vexation he came
home.</p>
<p>While all the robbers were going away from there, they met with yet
a man, and when he was asking, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; they
said, &ldquo;We are going for a means of livelihood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the man having spoken to them and said, &ldquo;If so,
come; there is a thatching at my house,&rdquo; and having gone to the
house, calling them, said, &ldquo;Here. Cover this large house with
straw.&rdquo; Having ordered it, he went away on a journey.</p>
<p>At that time, having got ready, and seen that a certain old woman
was in that house, they covered her with the whole of the straw.
Thereupon that woman becoming afraid, all at the house came while she
was crying out.</p>
<p>When they asked, &ldquo;What is this you are doing?&rdquo; they say,
&ldquo;The man who was at this house having said, &lsquo;Cover this
<span class="corr" id="xd27e3587" title=
"Source: mahage">mahag&#275;</span><a class="noteref" id="xd27e3589src"
href="#xd27e3589" name="xd27e3589src">2</a> with straw,&rsquo; went
away. That work we are doing,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the house men say, &ldquo;It is not that old woman. Cover
the <i>roof</i> with straw.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79"
href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the time when they said it they did the work in that manner; and
having gone to the lodgings (<i lang="si-latn">w&#257;&#7693;iya</i>)
where they were at first, and made that foolish thief stay there, the
six other persons went for a robbery. Stealing a certain tom-tom
beater&rsquo;s box of decorations they placed it at their lodgings, and
went to sleep.</p>
<p>That foolish robber having seen it, after those six persons went to
sleep, this fool putting on all those [things], stayed warming himself
at the fire. At that time, while sleep was going to fall heavily on
him, when the jingling bangles placed on his arms gave the [usual]
sound, one of those who were sleeping awoke and looked.</p>
<p>Having seen that the Yak&#257; of the box of decorations had come
and was [there], he spoke to the other men and bounded off. Thereupon
they also becoming afraid, the whole of them began to run away. Having
heard the noise, this one also got up, and he having gone running
behind them, the whole of them fell into a well and died.<a class=

<p class="first">In <i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i>
(Swynnerton), p. 140, a silly weaver went with three friends who were
thieves, to break into a house. They made a hole through the wall, and
telling him to wait outside and keep watch, the thieves entered. After
waiting some time he followed them, and began to cook some food that he
found near the fire. The owner&rsquo;s wife was sleeping close by on a
low bed; on turning over in her sleep her arm, palm uppermost, was
stretched out in front of the weaver. Thinking she was asking for some
of the food, he placed a spoonful boiling hot in her hand. She shrieked
out, the men were caught, and the King imprisoned the others, but
released the weaver.</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Les Avad&#257;nas</i> (Julien), No. xcvii, vol. ii,
p. 76, a party of comedians who were benighted on a mountain haunted by
men-eating demons, slept beside a fire. On account of the cold, one who
played as a R&#257;kshasa put on his own costume while the rest were
asleep. Several others on looking up saw a R&#257;kshasa there, and
fled; the rest followed, the man who had alarmed them running close
behind them. They left the mountain, crossed a river, threw themselves
into pools, and at last fell down worn out with fatigue. In
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=

<p>In <i>The Orientalist</i>, vol. i, p. 136 ff., in the tale of the
twenty-five idiots referred to in the notes to the last story, Miss S.

millet-grinding stone, the scalding of the old woman&rsquo;s mouth, and

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country a Prince went to ask about a
marriage, it is said. As he was going, while on the road he met with a
Princess. Having met with her, the two persons spoke angrily. Having
spoken thus, the Prince said to the Princess, &ldquo;Some day or other,
having called Her [in marriage], I will punish Her
much.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3656src" href="#xd27e3656"
name="xd27e3656src">1</a></p>
<p>Then the Princess said, &ldquo;Having borne a Prince to you, Sir,
and having employed the Prince [for it], I will tie you to your
horse&rsquo;s leg, and cause [them] to strike you fifty
blows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Prince, having come back, built brick walls like a
prison, and placed a drain in it, and caused a house to be prepared for
putting the Princess into when he brought her.</p>
<p>Having prepared it, and having come calling the Princess [in
marriage], he put her in the house; and he puts cooked rice for the
Princess at the corner of the drain. The Princess having eaten it, is
[there] without even going outside.</p>
<p>There were two field rats (<i lang="si-latn">waeli
m&#299;y&#333;</i>) which the Princess had reared before. The two came
to the place where this Princess is. Having come, they dug a tunnel
below the brick wall; having dug it, the Queen got out by the corner of
the tunnel, and came away.</p>
<p>Having come thus, she was in a party of dancing women. While there,
the Princess said to the dancing women, &ldquo;Take me, and go and
dance at such and such a city.&rdquo; She said this regarding the city
to which the Princess came in <i lang="si-latn">d&#299;ga</i>
[marriage]. &ldquo;While dancing there I shall faint. Then <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>while I
am there [in that state] you come away, having said, &lsquo;We shall
come again to call our child.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; She taught the women
thus.</p>
<p>The Princess having taught them it, these women danced near the
King, the father of the Prince who had placed her as though in prison
when she came in <i lang="si-latn">d&#299;ga</i> [marriage]. The Prince
also is there.</p>
<p>While dancing thus, the Princess fainted. Afterwards, these women
having said, &ldquo;Let her stay until the time when we come back to
call our child to go. We cannot now, while she is unconscious,&rdquo;
the women went away. The Princess remained there. That she was that
Prince&rsquo;s Princess he does not know. Having said that the Princess
will still be in that very [prison] house, he places cooked rice [there
for her] by means of the drain.</p>
<p>The women after three or four months came to call this Princess to
go. Then that Prince having married her, she was with child. The women,
notwithstanding that, called her and went away [with her].</p>
<p>Afterwards, when she was there a little time [with them] the
Princess bore a Prince.</p>
<p>The Prince became considerably big. Afterwards he asked at the hand
of the Princess, &ldquo;Mother, where is my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princess said, &ldquo;Son, your father is such and such a
King of such and such a city. The King having wagered that he will take
me in marriage, said that he will inflict on me unimposed punishments.
I said, &lsquo;Having borne a Prince to you, I will employ the Prince
and [get him to] tie you to your horse&rsquo;s leg, and cause you to be
struck fifty blows.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the way the King said, calling me [in marriage], when I
came he punished me like the punishment of the prison. Having come from
there by the help of two rats which I reared before, I was in the
dancing women&rsquo;s party. Being in it, and having gone to that city
to dance with these women, the women came away while I was there.
Afterwards they went back to come with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the time when I was there, the King marrying me, you
were born when these women were going about. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>While I
was there they came and called me. It is that King himself who is your
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Prince said, &ldquo;Mother, if so, seek a few things
for food for me, and give me them, for me to go to seek a livelihood
for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Princess found the things, and after she gave them,
the Prince, taking them, went to the house of a widow woman who worked
for hire, and said, &ldquo;Mother, I, also, came to stay with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the widow woman said, &ldquo;It is good; stay. I am
alone.&rdquo; Afterwards the Prince stayed there.</p>
<p>Staying there, this Prince began to steal the things of the city.
Then the King made it public that they are to catch the thief.
Afterwards they try to seize him; no one is able to seize him. That
widow woman also does not know [that he is the thief].</p>
<p>The woman having come [home], tells at the hand of the Prince all
the talk uttered at the royal palace: &ldquo;A thief of this country is
committing this robbery; they cannot catch the thief.&rdquo; All these
words she said to the Prince.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Prince said, &ldquo;Mother, cook a few cakes and give
me them.&rdquo; So the woman cooked cakes and gave them.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince, taking the cakes, went to the chena jungle,
and strung the cakes on the trees near a pool at the road (<i lang=
"si-latn">manka&#7693;a</i>) where a washerman is washing clothes.
Having strung them, keeping still two or three cakes in his hand, and
continuing to eat them, he came to the place where that washerman is
washing clothes.</p>
<p>Then the washerman asked at the hand of the Prince, &ldquo;Whence
come you eating and eating certain cakes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;And&#333;! The cake stems on these trees
having fruited, there are as many as you want (<i lang=
"si-latn">&#333;n&#257;e hae&#7789;iy&#275;</i>). Go there to
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, the washerman having said, &ldquo;If so, Chief (<i lang=
"si-latn">nilam&#275;</i>), be good enough to remain near these few
clothes,&rdquo; the washerman went to pluck the cakes.</p>
<p>Then the Prince, taking those few clothes, came to the house of the
widow woman. That washerman [after] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84"
href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>plucking the cakes having come
back, when he looked both the Prince was not there and the clothes were
not there. Afterwards the washerman went home empty-handed.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3733src" href="#xd27e3733" name=
"xd27e3733src">2</a></p>
<p>That Prince asked at the hand of the widow woman, &ldquo;Mother,
to-day, in the direction of that city&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it
so?&mdash;there is a report about the thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the widow woman said, &ldquo;And&#333;! Why not, son? To-morrow
the King is going, they say, to catch the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following day, taking also a bundle of clothes, he went to a
pool at the road, and having tied a cord to an earthen cooking-pot, and
sent the earthen pot into the water, continuing to tread on the cord
with his foot, [so as to keep the pot below the surface], he washes the
clothes.</p>
<p>Then the King came on horseback, together with the Ministers. This
Prince who is washing clothes asked at the hand of those Ministers,
&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ministers said, &ldquo;We are going to seize the
thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince says, &ldquo;Look here; he sprang into this water.
Having seen him coming, the King must be ready to seize him when he
comes to the surface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, the King descended from the back of his horse, and
having taken off the royal ornaments, putting on the bathing
cloth<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3751src" href="#xd27e3751" name=
"xd27e3751src">3</a> got ready to seize the thief at the time when he
rises to the surface.</p>
<p>Then this Prince deceitfully slackened a little the cord on which he
was treading with his feet; then the earthen pot which was in the water
rose to the surface a little. Having said, &ldquo;Perhaps it is the
head of the thief,&rdquo; those Ministers and the King sprang into the
water.</p>
<p>Then this Prince who was washing clothes, putting on those royal
ornaments, mounted on the [King&rsquo;s] horse, and said, &ldquo;Look
there! There is the thief, seize him!&rdquo; Then all having come near
that King seized him.</p>
<p>After that this Prince said, &ldquo;Having tied him to the leg of
this horse, [you are] to strike him fifty blows.&rdquo; Then those
Ministers, having taken the King and tied him to the horse&rsquo;s leg,
struck him fifty blows.</p>
<p>Having struck them, when they took him to the city the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>King&rsquo;s father says, &ldquo;That thief is
indeed like my son.&rdquo; Having looked in the direction of that
Prince who was wearing the royal ornaments, he said, &ldquo;This indeed
is not my son. What of that? There is a little like my son&rsquo;s
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Prince who was wearing the royal ornaments, said,
&ldquo;Ask at your son&rsquo;s hand who I am&rdquo;; he said it at the
hand of the Prince&rsquo;s grandfather.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>When he (the grandfather) asked at the hand of the King who had
become the thief, he said, &ldquo;I do not know who he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;If so, am I to tell you?&rdquo; He
said, &ldquo;H&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then at the hand of that King who had become the thief, this Prince
says, &ldquo;You brought for yourself the Queen of such and such a
city, did you not? Before bringing her there was an anger-wager, was
there not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;It is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;You will give punishment to the Queen,
you said, did you not? Then the Queen said, did she not? &lsquo;After I
have borne a Prince to you, having tied you to the leg of the horse I
will cause you to be struck fifty blows.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;It is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From there having brought the Queen, while you were giving
her the punishment the Queen had previously reared two field rats. The
two having come, dug [under] the brick wall, and the Queen went away
from there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having gone away, and been in a party of dancing women, while
she was in it one day they came here, the Queen and those women, to
dance. Having come and caused the Queen to stay, those women went away.
After three or four months the women came back, and calling her, went
away with her. While she was here,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3802src"

<p>Afterwards the grandfather said, &ldquo;You yourself remain
exercising the sovereignty. My son cannot; a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He having said this, the Prince himself received the
sovereignty.</p>

<p class="first">In <i>The Story of Madana K&#257;ma R&#257;ja</i>
(Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;), p. 246, a Prince told an
oilmonger&rsquo;s daughter that he would marry her and imprison her for
life. She retorted that she would bear him a son who should chastise
him after first tying him up in a sack. When they were married the
Prince shut her up in a room, her food being supplied through a small
window. She escaped by a tunnel made by her father for her, learnt
rope-dancing, and in disguise made a display of it before the court.
The Prince fell in love with her, visited her daily, and she obtained
from him his pearl necklace, diamond necklace, and ring. When the
rope-dancers left, the girl rejoined her father, and bore a son, who
learnt robbery and committed such daring thefts that the Prince, his
father, determined to seize him himself at night. By a trick he got the
Prince to enter a sack, dressed himself in the Prince&rsquo;s clothes,
and handed it to the soldiers as containing the thief. In the morning
he opened the sack and struck the Prince gently with the cord. The
robber then explained everything to the King and Prince, his mother
when fetched produced the articles given to her, and all ended
happily.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Fairy Tales</i> (M. Stokes), p. 216, a merchant on
leaving home on a long journey told his wife that on his return he
expected to find that she had built a grand well, and had a son for
him. By a trick she got money and built the well. Disguised as a
milk-girl she met with her husband&rsquo;s boat, and sold milk at the
river bank until he fell in love with her, married her, and took her to
live on his boat. When he left after three months, giving her his cap
and portrait, she returned home. On his arrival there she presented to
him his son, and produced his gifts.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. ii, p. 620, a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a told his bride, who had played a
trick on him, that he would desert her; she retorted that a son whom
she would bear him should bring him back. He put his ring on her finger
while she slept, and went away to his own city, Ujjayin&#299;. She
followed, and established herself as a courtesan, sending away each
visitor without seeing her, until her husband came and, without
recognising her, stayed some days with her. After returning home she
bore a son, to whom she told the whole story. The boy went in search of
his father, and by a wager made him his slave, took him back to his
mother, and they were reconciled.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Female Fowl Thief</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a village a woman was married to a man. The woman
has much fondness for food consisting of fowls&rsquo; flesh. The woman
having stolen the fowls, without the man&rsquo;s knowing it eats [them]
in the night when the man has gone to sleep. When she was eating every
day in this manner, the man perceived it one day.</p>
<p>After that, the man through the necessity for catching this theft,
one day said to the woman at night, &ldquo;Bolan, I cannot [bear] in
the cold. Go to the place where the bundles of firewood are, and bring
a little firewood.&rdquo; Then the woman says, &ldquo;An&#275;!
App&#257;! In this darkness I cannot go through fear.&rdquo; After
that, the man, not saying it again, remained without doing
anything.</p>
<p>On the following day, also, the man told her in the very same
manner. On that day, also, this woman said, &ldquo;An&#275;! App&#257;!
I cannot go alone.&rdquo; On both these days he was unable to catch the
woman&rsquo;s theft.</p>
<p>In the night of the following day the man lay down, and in the
manner as though asleep the man began to snore. On that day, too,
having said [to herself], &ldquo;The man has gone to sleep,&rdquo; the
woman arose and went for fowl stealing. The man having allowed the
woman to go, and having arisen also, began to go behind her.</p>
<p>On that day a man of the village having died had been cremated also.
The woman went to a village near the heap of fire-charcoal (the remains
of the funeral pyre), and stealing a fowl from a house, came near that
charcoal fire at the place of cremation (<i lang="si-latn">sohon</i>),
and having put the fowl upon the charcoal, roasted it. When she was
eating the meat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>that man, having been hidden, threw a stone [at
her]. When it struck her the woman says, &ldquo;What are you throwing
stones for?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3864src" href=
"#xd27e3864" name="xd27e3864src">1</a> Having said<span class="corr"
id="xd27e3867" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;Here. The
demon-offering for ye; take that,&rdquo; she throws down a fowl
bone.</p>
<p>The man gathers the bone which she throws. The man again throws a
stone. Having spoken in that very manner she throws away a bone; that
also the man gathers. The man again throws a stone. In this very
manner, the man having thrown stones, collected seven or eight bones.
[After] collecting them he came home before the woman, and lay
down.</p>
<p>The woman having eaten the flesh and having finished, came back, and
prepared to sleep. Then the man having gone to sleep [apparently], and
as through arising having broken up his bodily reluctance [to get up],
arose, and said, &ldquo;Bolan, I cannot [bear] in the cold; bring a
bundle of firewood from the place where the bundles of firewood
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That day, also, the woman said, &ldquo;An&#275;! App&#257;! I cannot
go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man scolds her: &ldquo;Bola, strumpet! During the whole
night thou canst go to steal fowls; why canst thou not go to bring a
bundle of firewood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, the woman having said, &ldquo;It is not so,&rdquo; began
to swear [to it]. Then the man having said, &ldquo;What are these,
Bola?&rdquo; showed her the fowl bones. Then the woman&rsquo;s breath
was drawn upward<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3884src" href="#xd27e3884"
name="xd27e3884src">2</a>; in that very way the woman&rsquo;s life
departed.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a Gampolay&#257; and a
Raehigamay&#257;,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3899src" href="#xd27e3899"
name="xd27e3899src">1</a> it is said.</p>
<p>The person called Gampolay&#257;, having put &#298;riya<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3904src" href="#xd27e3904" name="xd27e3904src">2</a>
fruits in two bags, and said they were areka-nuts, tied them as a pingo
load (one bag hanging under each end of the stick). Having been in his
own country, he is going away to another country.</p>
<p>The person called Raehigamay&#257; tied up a pingo load of pepper
(vine) leaves. The person called Raehigamay&#257;, having said that the
pingo load of pepper leaves was a pingo load of betel leaves,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3912src" href="#xd27e3912" name="xd27e3912src">3</a>
is also going away to another country.</p>
<p>At the time when he was going along there was a travellers&rsquo;
shed; in that travellers&rsquo; shed he lodged. That person called
Gampolay&#257;, taking that pingo load of &#298;riya fruits, came
there. Well then, those two persons came in contact [there].</p>
<p>The areka-nut trader (Gampolay&#257;) asked, &ldquo;What, friend, is
your pingo load?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The betel trader (Raehigamay&#257;) says, &ldquo;[Betel leaves]. In
our country areka-nuts are scarce to an inordinate (<i lang=
"si-latn">no-saehena</i>) extent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, [I have brought areka-nuts]. In that very
way, for our country there is difficulty over betel leaves,&rdquo;
Gampolay&#257; said. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91"
name="pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;If so, let us change our two pingo loads,&rdquo;
the person possessing areka-nuts took the pingo load of betel leaves;
the person who has the pingo load of betel leaves took the pingo load
of areka-nuts.</p>
<p>Gampolay&#257; [afterwards] says, &ldquo;I indeed met with a trading
at a profit!&rdquo; When he asked, &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; &ldquo;I
obtained a pingo load of betel leaves&rdquo; [he said]. Who asked it? A
man going on the road.</p>
<p>He took the pingo load of betel leaves to his country. Having gone
there and having untied it, when he looked it was a pingo load of
[worthless] pepper leaves. [The other man], taking the pingo load of
areka-nuts, went to his village. Having gone [there] and unfastened it,
when he looked they were [worthless] &#298;riya fruits.</p>
<p>Well then, those two persons came together at the travellers&rsquo;
shed on another day. They spoke: &ldquo;That day our trading did not go
on properly. Now then, friend, we two being thieves at this city,
[after] cooking rice and having eaten [together], at night let us go
for robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, except that those two say, &ldquo;Let us cook,&rdquo; not
even one of them brings the materials.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3938src" href="#xd27e3938" name="xd27e3938src">4</a> What is [the
reason why] they do not bring them? They were persons who on former
occasions had gone to the shop and brought things, [and had been
cheated by another person&rsquo;s not bringing any], they said. In that
manner it became night.</p>
<p>One person, having said he is going to bathe, [went away, and]
having eaten cooked rice at the shop, came back. The other [thought],
&ldquo;While he has gone to bathe, that one, going to the shop, will
eat rice;&rdquo; so this one having gone to another place ate cooked
rice [there].</p>
<p>A second time they came to the travellers&rsquo; shed. [Afterwards]
they broke [into] the palace of the King of that city. Taking the box
containing the gold things, and having gone [off with it], and during
that very night having arrived at a rice field, they went to sleep at
the bottom of a tree. Through dishonesty to one of them, the other,
taking the box <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>of things, bounded off. Having sprung off and
gone, he crept into a mound of straw, and remained there.</p>
<p>That [other] one having arisen, when he looked there was neither the
man nor the box of things. Thereafter he seeks and looks about. When he
was seeking and looking, [he noticed that] there was a threshing-floor
near [the place] where they were sleeping. Having taken a [wooden]
cattle-bell, on the following day, in the evening, he shook and shook
the cattle-bell, and began to gore the corn stacks and mounds of straw
that were at the threshing-floor.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3951src"
href="#xd27e3951" name="xd27e3951src">5</a> Then that man who had got
hid there, having said [to himself], &ldquo;Perhaps it is a
bull,&rdquo; spoke [to it, to drive it away]. Having spoken, when he
looked it was the first thief.</p>
<p>[When] they two are talking [about it, he said], &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t bring this box of things through dishonesty to you, but to
look at your cleverness.&rdquo; During all the time each one is
thinking of quietly taking the box of goods, and bounding off [with
it].</p>
<p>Well then, those two persons having come back, and having walked to
the sands of the sea, it became night. Placing that box of things in
the midst of the two, when they were lying down the person who stole it
at first went to sleep.</p>
<p>Then the other man, taking the box, hid it at a recognisable place
(<i lang="si-latn">ayiruwak</i>) in the sea. Having hidden it and come
back, and very quietly returned near the other one, he went to sleep.
The person who hid the box of things and returned, went to sleep.</p>
<p>Then the other one, having arisen very quietly, when he looks for
the box of things, the box of things is not there. When he sought and
looked about for it, he did not meet with it. [But] when he tasted
[with the tip of his tongue], and looked at the body (skin) of that
person who is sleeping, until the time when he comes [upward] near the
hip there is salt taste.</p>
<p>Now then, that one thought, &ldquo;He will have hidden it in the
water, waist deep in the sea.&rdquo; Having gone on account
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>of the thought, when he looked in the water to the
extent of a round [of the top] of the cloth (<i lang=
"si-latn">pili-wa&#7789;ak</i>, waist-deep) a tree was near. [The other
man] having placed it near the tree he met with it [there].</p>
<p>As soon as he met with it, taking the box of things and having come
to his village, he says to his wife and children, &ldquo;Having sought
me, should a man come here, say, &lsquo;He died yesternight. There is
delay in going to bury him, until the time when his relatives
assemble.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; Well then, they are lamenting
falsely.</p>
<p>Well, Gampolay&#257; [having come there] says, &ldquo;We, indeed,
called Gampolay&#257; and Raehigamay&#257;, walked about and committed
robbery at [each] city in turn. Now then, don&rsquo;t you be grieved
that he died; I am more troubled in my mind than you. The agreement of
us two indeed is that should I die first, he having come,&mdash;that
kind of creeper called Habaloss&#257;; it is an extremely bad sort of
thorn,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3977src" href="#xd27e3977" name=
"xd27e3977src">6</a>&mdash;having put [some] of the creepers on the
neck there is a promise to go dragging me until the time when he goes
to the edge of the grave. Should he die first the promise is [that I
should act] in that very manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, having brought a Habaloss&#257; creeper, and put it round
the neck of the person who was dead, when he prepared (<i>lit.</i>,
made) to drag him the person who was dead laughed. Having laughed, he
says, &ldquo;Friend, I did not bring the box of things on account of
stealing it, [but] to look if you are a clever person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, these two correctly divided in two the articles in the
box of things. The two persons [afterwards] dwelt in happiness.</p>

<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Bengal</i> (L. Behari Day), p. 165, when two
thieves were digging, the younger one came on a jar full of gold muhrs
(each worth about thirty shillings), and at once said it was only a
large stone. While the younger man slept the elder thief returned to
the spot, found there two jars of the coins, buried them in the mud of
an adjoining tank, returned, and fell asleep near the other. When the
younger thief awoke and found that the coins had been removed, he
noticed mud on his comrade&rsquo;s legs, made a search at the tank, got
the two jars, and went off with them, loaded on a cow. At dawn the
other man missed his partner and the money, and went in pursuit, and by
the slipper trick<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4003src" href="#xd27e4003"
name="xd27e4003src">7</a> got the cow and its load, and went home. When
the younger man came up they divided the money except an odd coin,
which was to be changed in the morning. In the morning the elder man
who had charge of it pretended to be dead. His friend affected to pity
the wife, made a straw rope, and dragged the body to the burning
ground, but having no fire he climbed up a tree. The two afterwards
frightened some robbers there, and got their booty.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i> (Swynnerton), p. 45,
some of the Sinhalese incidents occur in an account of the doings of
two merchants. One of them buried in the mud a brass plate which he
stole from the other&rsquo;s house. The owner found and removed it, and
the thief searched in vain for it. They cheated other people, and
acquired forty thousand rupees with which one of them made off; the
other recovered it by the slipper trick, buried it, pretended to be
dead, and at the cemetery the two men frightened some robbers, got
their booty, and made an equal division of all.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of the Telugus</i> (G. R. Subramiah Pantulu), p.
63, a man set out with a packet containing a quart of sand; a man of a
different village was journeying with a packet containing a lump of
cow-dung. They met in the evening, and halted at the same rest-house.
Each wanted to get the other&rsquo;s packet, thinking it contained
food. The second man said he had a packet of food (apparently cooked)
but was not hungry, and asked the other what he had brought. The first
one replied that he had uncooked rice with him, and felt very hungry.
They exchanged packets, went off at once to avoid recriminations, and
discovered that they were mutually cheated.</p>

"#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>clay entirely hidden under cooked
rice grains which his wife had stuck on it met with a man of
Trichinopoly who had a brass pot full of sand covered with raw rice a
quarter of an inch deep. Each wanted the other&rsquo;s rice. The first
man stated that not being very well he was afraid to eat the cold rice
he had brought, and would like to cook some raw rice. The second man
made an exchange with him. After discovering that they were mutually
cheated they became friendly, and had other experiences of each
other&rsquo;s roguery (see the variant given after No. 248).</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. ii, p. 109, a foolish man, in order to avoid sharing with a friend
some tasty food which his wife was cooking, pretended to be dead. The
friend lamented loudly, neighbours came, they made a pyre at the
burning ground, put the body on it and burnt it, the man having
determined to die rather than give a share of the food.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i> (Knowles), 2nd ed., p. 299, when two
thieves had stolen some treasure from a caravan, one of them by means
of the slipper trick got the whole, hurried home, and the pretended
death and adventure with the robbers followed.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales from Tibet</i> (O&rsquo;Connor), p. 131, when two
thieves by a fraud had secured a heavy bag of gold, one of them
absconded with it. The other recovered the money by the boot-trick.</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol.
ii, p. 316, a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a who had some peas which were so old
that it was impossible to cook them, took them to the market, and
exchanged them for an ass which would never move when a load was put on
its back, each of the barterers thinking he had got the best of the
bargain.</p>
<p>In the Sierra Leone stories, <i>Cunnie Rabbit</i>, etc. (Cronise and
Ward), p. 300, there is a variant of the latter part of the Sinhalese
tale in an account of two greedy men who lived in the east and west.
The eastern man came to the western man&rsquo;s house carrying a box,
and would not leave, intending to share in the rice that had been
cooked. The owner of the house at last lay down, and told his wife to
say he had died. The visitor remained all night, supplied clothes for
the corpse, made a coffin, dug the grave, and had nearly covered the
body when it requested to be taken out. In the end, the visitor got a
share of their food. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96"

<h2 class="main">The Story of the Two Liars</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are two Liars called the Eastern Liar and the
Western Liar, it is said. The Eastern Liar was minded to go to seek the
Western Liar, it is said.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4056src" href=
"#xd27e4056" name="xd27e4056src">1</a> Should you say, &ldquo;What was
that for?&rdquo; it was for telling lies in competition (<i>i.e.</i>, a
lying match), it is said.</p>
<p>Tying up the packet of cooked rice from one and a half <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e4064" title=
"Source: amunas">amu&#7751;as</span><a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4066src" href="#xd27e4066" name="xd27e4066src">2</a> of uncooked
rice, and the flesh of twelve goats, and bringing it for the [mid] day
food, he went to the house of the Western Liar. At the time when he was
going there, the Liar was not at home; a daughter of his was there. He
gave her the packet of cooked rice to put away. She took the packet of
cooked rice with the point of the needle with which she was sewing and
sewing, and put it away.</p>
<p>The Eastern Liar [asked] the female child, &ldquo;Where is thy
father? In the forest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the child [said], &ldquo;Our father [in order] to cover up
the thundering went to skin a mosquito, and come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon this very Liar, having become afraid, thinks, &ldquo;At
the time when this very child told lies to this degree, when her father
has come to what extent will he tell lies?&rdquo; Thinking it, and
asking for the packet of cooked rice again, he went off back again.
Because it was not yet day<a class="noteref" id="n96.3src" href=
"#n96.3" name="n96.3src">3</a> [enough] for eating in the
daytime,<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n96.3">3</a> having hung the
bundle of cooked rice on a large Banyan tree he went to sleep.</p>
<p>After that, at the time when the Western Liar, cutting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>sticks
and creepers for a house and placing them under his armpits, was
coming, the little female child who was at the house having gone in
front [of him], says, &ldquo;A man came to seek you,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the man asked, &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look; he went there,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Thereupon this very person, taking those sticks and creepers, and
turning to the same quarter, went in chase of him.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4092src" href="#xd27e4092" name="xd27e4092src">4</a></p>
<p>At that time the Eastern Liar had gone to sleep. Having heard the
sound of the coming of the Western Liar, he arose. That person having
become frightened at the sound of his (the Western Liar&rsquo;s)
coming, to take the packet of cooked rice seized the branch on which is
the packet of cooked rice. Thereupon the tree, being completely
uprooted, came into his hand. Taking also the tree itself, the same
person having got in front ran away. This very person (the Western
Liar), for [the purpose of] looking who it is, began to drive this very
person backwards.</p>
<p>Having heard this very sound, and having said, &ldquo;Something is
coming to happen in the country,&rdquo; an elephant-keeper who looked
after a hundred tusk elephants, having sent off the elephants to their
food and having become afraid, was looking about. Through that very
despondency [which he felt] that some danger was coming to arrive at
this very village, he said, &ldquo;I must go to some other
quarter&rdquo;; and folding up the cloth in which he was dragging (=
carrying) them, and in which were the whole hundred tusk elephants, he
bolted.</p>
<p>Then having gone to an outer open place, and having unfastened the
cloth, when he looked [inside it], only the two white lice called Gourd
and Ash-pumpkin were [there], having eaten the whole hundred tusk
elephants.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Three He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;s</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there were three persons, Big
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, Middle He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, and Little
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;. During the time while they were there, the
three persons having gone to dig [for] gems, dug [for] gems until the
money of the parties was finished. They did not meet with even one
gem.</p>
<p>Because they did not, having come again to the village, certain
acquaintances of those people were there. Taking (that is, borrowing) a
little money from those parties, the whole three persons dug [for] gems
again in partnership until the money was finished. They met with only
one gem.</p>
<p>It was in the mind of Big He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; to get it into a
big box. It was in the mind of Middle He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; to get
it into a middle [sized] box. It was in the mind of Little
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; to get it into a little box.</p>
<p>Well then, the three persons having quarrelled about it, Little
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; made a little box, Middle
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; made a box larger than that, Big
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; made a box still larger than that.</p>
<p>Having made them, they placed the gem in the little box of Little
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, that box they placed inside Middle
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s box, and having put it in they placed
that box inside Big He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s box. [Each one
kept the key of his own box.]</p>
<p>Having put it away in that manner, those three still borrowing a
little money from suitable persons of the neighbourhood, went again to
dig [for] gems.</p>
<p>During the time while they were staying in that way, Little
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, having made two false keys for Big
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s box and Middle
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s box, and opened both the boxes, taking
out his own box and opening that box with the key he had, took the gem
and hid it. This one, having thrown away both the false keys, remained
like a man who had not committed theft.</p>
<p>Not a long time after that, the men who lent the money came to ask
for the money. Until the time when the money was finished they dug
[for] gems; from it also they obtained nothing.</p>
<p>After that, these three persons spoke to the creditors,
&ldquo;Having sold the gem which we have, let us give the money to
these people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said so, the whole three having come, Big
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, with the key that he had, opened the big box;
Middle He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, with the key that he had, opened
[his]; Little He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, with the key that he had,
opened [his]. When they looked there was no gem.</p>
<p>After that, the three keys being in the hands of the three persons,
having said, &ldquo;Who opened [the boxes]?&rdquo; the three persons
struck each other.</p>
<p>[After] striking, they went near the King for a law suit. Having
gone, the whole three persons said, &ldquo;O Lord, Your Majesty, we
three had a gem. Having put the gem into a little box, and put that
into a still larger box, and put that into a still larger box, we three
persons kept in our hands the three keys. Thereafter, when we three
persons came together and looked [for it], it was not [there]. Because
of it, Sir, somehow or other you must clear up this for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King made much effort to sift the law suit. He being
unable to explain the case, began to postpone it.</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s Queen having seen that the three
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;s are coming every day in this manner to the
court of justice, one day asked the King, &ldquo;O Lord, Your Majesty,
three He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;s come every day to the court of justice.
Why?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;The three He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;s having dug
[for] gems, there was one gem. Little He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; having
made a box and put it in, locked it and kept the key near
him<span class="corr" id="xd27e4150" title="Not in source">.</span>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>Middle He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; having made a
larger box than that, and placed that Little
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s little box inside it, locked it and
kept that key. Big He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; having made a large box,
taking both those boxes placed them inside that box, and having locked
it, he kept that key. Leaving the keys in the hands of the three
persons, the gem was missing. I have been unable to explain the case.
Because of it I postpone it every day,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, the Queen said, &ldquo;If you will give me the
sovereignty I will clear up the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he said, &ldquo;It is good. Until you have heard the
action I will give [you] the sovereignty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; the Queen went away and
informed the Ministers, and told them to bring three bundles of cord
and a whip. These people came bringing them.</p>
<p>After that, the Queen having placed Big He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; on
a support, told them to tie him. Having tied him, taking the whip and
having said, &ldquo;Will you give the gem? Will you give the
gem?&rdquo; she told them to flog him well. They flogged the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; until blood came. Even after that he said,
&ldquo;No, indeed (<i lang="si-latn">n&aelig;&#772;ma</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having also tied Middle He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; in that manner,
they flogged him; that He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; said, &ldquo;No,
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having seized and tied up Little He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; also, they
flogged him in that very way. When they had been striking four or five
blows, he said, &ldquo;I will give the gem.&rdquo; After that, she told
him to bring the gem.</p>
<p>That Little He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; having gone running, when he
came [after] taking it from the dung-hill where he had buried and kept
it, she told Big He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; and Middle
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; to divide [the value of] it. She gave nothing
to Little He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;.</p>
<p>Big He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; and Middle He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;
divided [the value of] it between them.</p>

<h2 class="main">Concerning Two Friends</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain time there were two men, friends. Of
them, one person not having [food] to eat, was very poor. The other man
had amply to eat and drink. At that time the man who had not [food] to
eat, in order to get an assistance went near the friend who had [food]
to eat. Then at the time when he went to the friend&rsquo;s house,
having amply given him food and drink, the friend asked, &ldquo;What
have you come for?<span class="corr" id="xd27e4187" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Thereupon the man said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Dear friend, not having to
eat and to wear I came near you in order to get an
assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man having gone calling him to the bread shop, taking bread
for ten shillings gave it to him, and said, &ldquo;Here, friend,
selling these things get a living. I am unable to give an assistance
for more than ten shillings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the man having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; at the time
when he was bounding about taking the bread box having walked until it
was becoming black, did not sell [anything]. Through anger that he did
not sell it, this man sat down near a tree, and said, &ldquo;This day
on which I got the evil-looking (<i lang="si-latn">m&#363;sala</i>)
bread is not good; I will eat these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time, the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; who was in the tree,
having become afraid, said, &ldquo;An&#275;! O Lord, don&rsquo;t eat
me; I will give you a good article,&rdquo; and gave him a plate.</p>
<p>The man, taking the plate, asked, &ldquo;With this plate what shall
I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; said, &ldquo;Having taken away the
plate, and well polished it, and spread a white cloth, place it upon
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>table. Then you will receive tasty food [from
it].&rdquo; So the man, taking the plate, came to the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>The He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; asked, &ldquo;Appuh&#257;mi, have you
met with anything even to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;To-day, indeed, I met with a plate.&rdquo; [He
gave the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; an account of its good
properties.]</p>
<p>Thereupon, the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, having made the man drink
arrack (spirit distilled from palm-juice), and made him drunk, and
allowed him to sleep on the bed, took the plate. Taking it, he put
another plate into the man&rsquo;s bread box.</p>
<p>Then the man having become conscious, and gone home, told the
man&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cook; we shall receive
food.&rdquo; Having well polished the plate, and spread a white cloth,
placing it upon the table he waited.</p>
<p>Having ascertained that cooked rice did not descend, the man&rsquo;s
wife came, and taking the plate threw it away, and having cooked,
ate.</p>
<p>On the following day, also, the man having walked without selling
bread, came near that tree, and said in the former way, &ldquo;I will
eat. I will eat.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4220src" href=
"#xd27e4220" name="xd27e4220src">1</a></p>
<p>Thereupon, the Yak&#257;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4225src" href=
"#xd27e4225" name="xd27e4225src">2</a> on that day gave him a ring, and
said, &ldquo;Having sold the ring, when you are going ten fathoms away
the ring will come and place itself again in your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that day, also, the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; asked [what he had
met with]. The man, just as in the former manner, said, &ldquo;I
obtained a ring,&rdquo; [and told him its property]. So the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; on that day, also, made the man drunk, and
taking the ring and having caused another ring to be made, put it on
the man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The man having become conscious, and gone away taking the ring, sold
it. Having sold it, he went ten fathoms, and looked. That, also, did
not come.</p>
<p>Then the man on the following day also came without having sold the
bread, and having come near that tree, said on that day, also, just as
in the former manner. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>At that time the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; gave him a cow which drops
gold. &ldquo;Having taken away this cow, take good care of it, and tie
it up and keep it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the man, taking also the cow, just as before went away
near that He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s house. The
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; that day also asked, &ldquo;What is it,
Appuh&#257;mi, that you have obtained to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;To-day, indeed, I obtained,
He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la, a cow which drops gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, that day also having given the man
arrack to drink, and made him drunk, and allowed him to sleep on the
bed, brought the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s old cow, and having
tied it there the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; took the cow which drops
gold.</p>
<p>Then that man having become conscious, and having gone away taking
that cow also, washed the cow-dung which the cow dropped. Excepting
cow-dung, there was no gold.</p>
<p>Thereupon the man on the following day, also, having gone for
bread-selling did not sell [any]. That day, also, he went near that
tree, and said, &ldquo;Thou son of a courtesan, when I told thee to
provide me with a living thou cheatedst me. On account of it, to-day I
shall eat thee indeed,&rdquo; and he began to chase the Yak&#257; on
the path.</p>
<p>Then the Yak&#257; said, &ldquo;O Lord, do not chase me on the
path.&rdquo; The D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; well knows about the theft of
the articles. Having said, &ldquo;The things that I give to this man
yet [another] man takes,&rdquo; he gave him a cudgel.</p>
<p>The man asked, &ldquo;With this cudgel what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yak&#257; said, &ldquo;Should anyone ask, &lsquo;What is
this?&rsquo; say &lsquo;Allan Bostan&#805;.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4254src" href="#xd27e4254" name="xd27e4254src">3</a> Having
said it, say, &lsquo;Stop, Bostan&#805;,&rsquo; [in order to stop
it].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man, taking the cudgel, went just as before to the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s house. At that time the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, in the very same way as before, asked [what
he had received].</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;To-day I obtained a cudgel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; asked, &ldquo;What is the name of
the cudgel?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104"
name="pb104">104</a>]</span></p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;That, indeed, is Allan Bostan&#805;.&rdquo;
Then the cudgel went and began to beat the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;.</p>
<p>Thereupon the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; said, &ldquo;Lord,
don&rsquo;t beat me. I will give you all the things I took.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the man said, &ldquo;Stop, Bostan&#805;.&rdquo; Then the cudgel
stopped the beating. After that [the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;] gave him
that stolen plate and ring, and the cow that dropped gold, these very
three things. After that, the man having become wealthy, remained
so.</p>

<p class="first">In <i>The Story of Madana K&#257;ma R&#257;ja</i>
(Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;), p. 130, a Prince stole the
articles left by a dying Sanny&#257;si,&mdash;a cup which supplied
food, a bag which yielded everything desired, sandals that transported
their wearer where he wished to go, and a cudgel which thrashed all
enemies but is not mentioned again. By means of the bag he obtained a
palace, but two dancing women cheated him and stole all his magical
articles; he recovered them by the aid of some miraculous fruits.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Bengal</i> (L. Behari Day), p. 53, an indigent
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a received from the goddess Durg&#257; an earthen pot
out of which food fell when it was reversed. At an inn it was changed
for a common one, and he was driven away. Durg&#257; gave him another
pot out of which when reversed a number of demons issued and beat him,
returning to it when it was set mouth upwards. When he was bathing the
innkeeper reversed the pot, was thrashed by the demons, and the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a regained the pot formerly stolen.</p>
<p>In <i>Folklore of the Santal Parganas</i> (collected by Dr.
Bodding), p. 83, an indigent Prince received a magic cow that granted
everything desired, from a jackal whose protection he craved. It was
afterwards changed by a man at whose house he lodged for the night, but
by the help of the jackal he recovered it.</p>
<p>In <i>Old Deccan Days</i> (M. Frere), p. 182, a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a
who had seven daughters married the eldest to a jackal who was in
reality a R&#257;ja in disguise and a magician. He gave the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a a melon to plant; the fruits, which were ripe next
day, contained precious stones, but, unaware of it, the man sold some
and was cheated out of the others. The jackal gave him a pot which
contained food when required, a R&#257;ja took it, and the man then
received from his son-in-law another pot containing a stick and rope
which would tie and beat people when ordered. When the R&#257;ja,
hearing he had got a better pot than before, came to take it, the man
caused him and his attendants to be beaten until he got back the former
pot. In the same way he recovered all the precious stones.</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol.
iii, p. 256, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>a religious mendicant gave an inexhaustible jar
of copper to a poor man who had presented food to him, and warned him
against inviting the King to his house. The man neglected the advice,
and the King took the jar. He then received from the donor a pot filled
with sticks and stones. When he demanded the copper jar the King
ordered him to be seized, but the men were beaten by the articles which
issued from the second jar, and the King returned the first one. In the
same volume, p. 267, there is an account of a rice measure, a jar of
ambrosia, and a bag of jewels which were all inexhaustible. When a King
sent men to take them a magical stick drove them away.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Fairy Tales</i> (M. Stokes), p. 32, a foolish youth
broke cakes into five pieces in the jungle, and said, &ldquo;Now
I&rsquo;ll eat this one, then the second, then the third, then the
fourth, and then the fifth.&rdquo; The fairies who haunted the place
thought he was about to devour them, and gave him a cooking pot out of
which any food could be procured; at a cook&rsquo;s shop it was changed
for a common one. When no food issued from this, he took five more
cakes, repeated the words, received a box which produced any clothes
required, and was drugged by the cook, who substituted a common box for
it. He again took five cakes, and received a rope and stick which would
tie and beat men when ordered. With these he recovered the other
articles.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. i, p. 13, a King called Putraka persuaded two Asuras to race for
the possession of articles left by their father,&mdash;shoes on which
one could fly, a staff that wrote only truth, and a food vessel. The
King then put on the shoes, carried off the other things, and founded
the city called P&#257;&#7789;al&#299;putra after
P&#257;&#7789;al&#299; (his wife) and himself. The translator gave
references to an Indian variant in which the rod is replaced by a
purse, and to European examples.</p>
<p>In vol. ii., p. 3, of the same work four Yakshas presented a poor
man with an inexhaustible food pitcher. When his kinsmen inquired about
it he took it on his shoulder and began to dance, his foot slipped, the
pitcher fell and was broken, and he reverted to his former poverty.
This story is found in <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues</i>
(Chavannes), vol. ii, p. 74. Inexhaustible bowls filled with jewels are
mentioned in vol. ii, p. 220, also.</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Les Avad&#257;nas</i> (Julien), vol. ii, p. 8, and
<i lang="fr">Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues</i>, vol. ii, p. 185, the
story of the demons (Pi&#347;&#257;cas) is almost the same as that
above quoted. In the latter work, vol. iii, p. 259, two persons were
quarrelling over a hat which rendered the wearer invisible, shoes with
which he could walk on water, and a cudgel that would beat a person to
death. When they raced for an arrow that a man shot he made off with
the things.</p>
<p>In <i>Sagas from the Far East</i>, p. 84, in a Kalmuk tale, a man
who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>frightened away some demons found that they had
left an inexhaustible gold goblet which provided food and drink. He
exchanged it for a magic cudgel, a hammer which when struck on the
ground nine times caused a nine story tower to rise, and a goat-skin
bag out of which rain fell when it was shaken, in each case sending
back the cudgel to recover the articles.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata</i> (<i lang=
"sa-latn">Va&#7751;a Parva</i>, iii) <span class="corr" id="xd27e4344"
title="Source: Yudhisthira">Yudhishthira</span> recited a Hymn to the
Sun, on which this deity bestowed on him an inexhaustible copper pot
out of which fruit, roots, meat, and vegetables were produced.</p>
<p>There is a Bamana variant from the interior of Senegambia, given in
<i lang="fr">Contes Soudanais</i> (C. Monteil), p. 58. A hy&aelig;na
found a small pot called The Generous Pot, out of which he obtained
rice, kus-kus (large millet), and other food. His hostess informed the
King, who after testing it, kept it, and attached it to his arm. The
hy&aelig;na then found a cutlas which told him its name was
Cutlas-who-strikes. The King heard from his hostess that it was better
than the pot. When he took it the hy&aelig;na stood beside his arm on
which the pot hung, told him the name of the cutlas, and while it was
striking him snatched away the pot and absconded.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk Stories from Southern Nigeria</i> (Dayrell), p. 20, a
King had a drum the beating of which caused food to appear, but if the
owner stepped over a stick or tree the food went bad, and men with
sticks beat the guests and owner. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107"

<h2 class="main">Concerning Four Friends</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a single country there were four friends. During
the time while they were staying there all four reared a dog. At the
time when it had grown up the dog became extremely large.</p>
<p>After that, the four persons having spoken together: &ldquo;Let us
divide the [ownership of the] dog [among us],&rdquo; divided the dog,
to one person the fore-leg, to one person the hind-leg; in this manner
the four persons divided it into four [shares].</p>
<p>[After] dividing it, when no long time had gone, one fore-leg of the
dog was broken. After it was broken, the other three persons having
told the man who owned the fore-leg that the fore-leg was broken, found
fault [with him for not attending to it].</p>
<p>Thereupon the man, taking a medicine and an oil for it, soaked a
rag, and tied it round [the leg]. After he had tied it round, the dog
went near the hearth, and while it was staying there the fire caught
that oiled rag.</p>
<p>The four persons had planted a cotton garden, and having [picked
and] dried the cotton, had heaped it up. This dog&rsquo;s body coming
against the heap of cotton, the fire caught it, and all the cotton
burnt away.</p>
<p>After that, the four persons quarrelled [over it], and beat each
other. [After] beating each other, they went near the King of the
country. The whole three persons brought actions against the man [for
the value of their shares of the burnt cotton].</p>
<p>How did they bring them? &ldquo;An&#275;! O Lord, Your Majesty, we
were rearing a dog and planting a cotton garden. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>We
four persons divided the [ownership of the] dog [into shares]. While we
were there after dividing it, the fore-leg belonging to this owner was
broken. He wrapped it in a cloth [soaked in] oil for wounds. The dog,
having gone near the hearth, was sleeping. The fire caught the dog.
When it caught it, the dog having gone, jumped upon the heap of cotton
which had been dried and heaped up. The cotton was burnt up. Because of
it, we ask for [the amount of] the loss from this man.&rdquo; They
brought the action thus.</p>
<p>The man says, &ldquo;I am not a guilty person. I only wrapped the
oiled rag on the fore-leg for the wound to heal. I did not do it in
order to burn the cotton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon those other three persons [said], &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
know that. It is owing to you indeed that the cotton was burnt. Because
of it, you must pay the [amount of the] loss to us three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that the King asked, &ldquo;Was the dog&rsquo;s broken leg so
thoroughly broken that it could not place the foot on the
ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three persons said, &ldquo;It could not place the foot on the
ground even a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King having considered, said regarding it, &ldquo;Because
it went by means of the three legs which belonged to you three persons,
by your fault the cotton has been burnt, and [the amount of] his loss
must be given to that one by you three persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, by those three persons the price of his share of the
cotton was paid to the other man.</p>

<p class="first">This is one of the stories related of Mariyada

four dealers in cotton reared a cat, each one owning one leg. The
judgment was that given by the King in the Sinhalese version. This form

<h2 class="main">Concerning a Horse</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A man, taking a horse, went on its back. When so going
the [skin on the] horse&rsquo;s back was broken, [a sore being formed
which rendered the horse unserviceable]. After it was broken, the man
removing the few horse cloths, while the horse was [left] there went
away.</p>
<p>An oil trader, when coming on that path taking oil, having seen that
[the skin on] this horse&rsquo;s back was broken, smeared a little of
that oil on it, and went away.</p>
<p>Still [another] man having come, when he looked [saw that] a horse
had fallen down. When the man looked at it he saw that the [skin on
the] back was broken, and that man, taking a great many large rags,
bandaged the back well, for it to become strong. Having bandaged it,
and having further poured a little oil on it, he went away.</p>
<p>Near the path on which was the horse a man cut a chena, and set fire
to the chena. When it was blazing some fire-sparks having come and
fallen on the oil-rags on this horse&rsquo;s back, the fire seized the
horse. Having seized it, when [the rags were] burning it was unable to
get up [at first]. The horse having got up, and gone running, jumped
into a citronella (<i lang="si-latn">paengiri</i>) garden, and while it
was running there and here, the fire seized the citronella plants, and
the citronella plants burnt completely.</p>
<p>The man who owned that citronella garden went near the King for the
law-suit. Having gone, he said to the King, &ldquo;O Lord, Your
Majesty, a horse, which having broken [the skin of] its back was
wrapped with oil-rags, having jumped into my citronella garden, the
citronella garden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110"
name="pb110">110</a>]</span>was totally burnt.&rdquo; Having said this
he instituted the action.</p>
<p>Regarding it the King said, &ldquo;It is not the fault of the man
who wrapped the oil-rags round it. It is not the fault of the horse.
Because thou didst not tie the fence [properly] the fault is thine,
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse having been burnt in that very fire, died.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Story of the Pearl Necklace</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain city there are a King and a Queen, it is
said. While they are there, one day the Queen with the female slave
went to bathe at the pool in the King&rsquo;s garden. Having gone
there, the Queen, having taken off her garments and put them down,
placed her necklace upon the garments; and having told the female slave
to stay there the Queen went into the pool, and is bathing. Then the
female slave went to bathe.</p>
<p>A thievish female Grey Monkey (<i lang="si-latn">Waendiriyak</i>)
that was in the garden, took the necklace, and having placed it in a
hole in a tree remained silent.</p>
<p>The Queen having bathed and come ashore, when she looked for the
necklace while putting on her garments, there was no necklace.
Afterwards she asked at the hand of the female slave, &ldquo;Where,
Bola, is the necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the female slave said, &ldquo;I did not see a person who came
here and went away [with it].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then both of them having come to the palace, the Queen told the King
that thieves took the necklace. Thereupon the King caused the Ministers
to be brought, and said, &ldquo;Go quickly and seek ye the
necklace.&rdquo; The Ministers speedily tying [up their
cloths],<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4448src" href="#xd27e4448" name=
"xd27e4448src">1</a> began to run [in search of it].</p>
<p>At that time a poor man from a distant place came into the jungle to
seek sticks and creepers. When he was coming, the Ministers watching
there were saying, &ldquo;Seize him; he bounded away here.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>This poor man having heard it thought to himself, &ldquo;Should I
stay here they will seize me. Because of it, having bounded away from
here I must go to my village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time when the man was running away, the Ministers having gone
and seized the man, and beaten and beaten the man with their hands and
feet, took him near the King.</p>
<p>Thereupon the King asked at the hand of the man, &ldquo;Didst thou
take a gold [and pearl] necklace in this manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man thought to himself, &ldquo;Should I say that I did not
take this necklace, the King will behead me. Because of it, I must say
that I took it.&rdquo; Having thought this, he said, &ldquo;I took
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King asked, &ldquo;Where is it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;I gave it to the Treasurer (<i lang=
"si-latn">si&#7789;&#257;n&#333;</i>) of this city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the King having caused the Treasurer to be brought,
asked, &ldquo;Did this man give thee a necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Treasurer thought to himself, &ldquo;Should I say that
he did not give it to me, he will now behead this poor man. Because of
it, I must say that he gave it to me.&rdquo; Having thought this, he
said, &ldquo;He gave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King asked, &ldquo;Where is the necklace now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Treasurer said, &ldquo;I gave it to a courtesan
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the King caused the courtesan woman to be brought.
&ldquo;Did this Treasurer give thee a necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the courtesan woman thought to herself, &ldquo;What will
this be about, that such a Treasurer said he gave me a necklace?
Because of it, it is bad to say he did not give it; I must say he gave
it.&rdquo; Having thought this, she said, &ldquo;He gave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King asked, &ldquo;Where is it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The courtesan woman says, &ldquo;I gave it to the man who knows the
science of astrology (<i lang="si-latn">ganita
s&aelig;&#772;stara</i>), or to the G&#257;ndargay&#257;&rdquo;
(<i>sic</i>).</p>
<p>Afterwards the King having caused the G&#257;ndargay&#257; to be
brought, asked, &ldquo;Did this courtesan woman give thee a
necklace?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113"
name="pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>At that time the G&#257;ndargay&#257; thought to himself,
&ldquo;What is this thing that this woman said? It will be about
something regarding which the woman is unable to save herself. It is
because of that [she will have said] that I took it that day. Because
of it, it is not good to say she did not give me it; I must say she
gave it.&rdquo; Having thought this he said, &ldquo;She gave
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, on that day it became night; there was no time to hear
the case. After that, the Ministers said, &ldquo;Having put all these
four persons in one room, outside we must listen secretly to the manner
in which this party talk.&rdquo; The King gave permission [to act
accordingly]. Afterwards, the Ministers having put the four persons in
one room, and shut the door, stayed outside secretly listening.</p>
<p>Then firstly that Treasurer asked at the hand of that poor man,
&ldquo;When didst thou give me a necklace? What is this thing thou
saidst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the poor man says, &ldquo;An&#275;! O Treasurer, I am a very
poor man. Your Honour is a very wealthy person. Because of it, in order
that I may save myself I said that I gave it to Your Honour. It was for
that. Otherwise, when did I give Your Honour a necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards that courtesan woman asked at the hand of the Treasurer,
&ldquo;O Treasurer, when did you give me a necklace? What is this you
said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Treasurer says, &ldquo;Thou, also, art a possessor of much
wealth. I also am a person who has much wealth. On account of it,
because we two can escape from this injury that has occurred [to us], I
said it. Otherwise, when did I give thee a necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the G&#257;ndargay&#257; asked the woman, &ldquo;What, woman,
is this thing that thou saidst? When didst thou give me a
necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The courtesan woman says, &ldquo;An&#275;! O
G&#257;ndarvay&#257;,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4512src" href=
"#xd27e4512" name="xd27e4512src">2</a> thou, having said sooth, art a
person who obtains much wealth. Because of it, as we, having even paid
the debt (the value of the necklace), can escape, I said it. Otherwise,
when did I give thee a necklace?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Well then, the talk of the four persons was heard by the Ministers
who were secretly listening. That day, after it became light, taking
the four persons out, they took them near the King. The Ministers who
had listened in secret said to the King, &ldquo;These four persons are
not the thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King asked the Ministers, &ldquo;How did ye ascertain that
they are not thieves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ministers said, &ldquo;We stayed listening in secret; by that we
ascertained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;If so, who are the thieves who took this
necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Ministers said, &ldquo;According to the way in which it
appears to us, maybe it is a thievish female Grey Monkey that is in the
garden, who took the necklace.&rdquo; The Ministers said, &ldquo;You
ought to set free these four persons.&rdquo; After that, the King
having released the four persons sent them away.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Ministers having gone to the garden, caught a male
Grey Monkey. [After] catching it they came to the palace, and having
sewn the jacket and breeches, and put the jacket on the Monkey, and put
the breeches [on it], and put flower garlands [on it], and dressed the
Monkey, and again sent the Monkey to the garden, the Ministers remained
looking on.</p>
<p>Then that thievish female Grey Monkey who took the necklace, having
seen the Monkey that had been clothed, went to the fork of the tree in
which she placed the necklace, and placing the necklace on her neck,
came outside.</p>
<p>These Ministers having seen it, the Ministers clapped their hands
[to frighten her]. At the time when they were saying
&ldquo;H&#363;,&rdquo; as that female Grey Monkey was going jumping and
jumping from tree to tree, the necklace that was on the female
Monkey&rsquo;s neck fell to the ground.</p>
<p>After that, the Ministers went, and picking it up, came to the royal
palace and presented it to the King. On account of it, the King having
become much pleased with the Ministers gave them many offices.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is evidently the J&#257;taka story No. 92 (vol.
i, p. 224), in which the man who was first caught declared that he gave
the necklace to the Treasurer, who said that he passed it on to the
Chaplain, who stated that it was given to the Chief Musician, who said
he handed it to the Courtesan. To make the monkey produce and wear it,
a number of bead necklaces were placed on the necks<span class="corr"
id="xd27e4544" title="Not in source">,</span> wrists and ankles of
other monkeys that were caught. In this story the last person charged
totally denied having received the necklace.</p>
<p>In A. von Schiefner&rsquo;s <i>Tibetan Tales</i> (Ralston), p. 181,
the Queen hung the necklace on a tree, whence a monkey stole it. A
beggar who was arrested first charged a merchant with receiving it from
him, and afterwards also, as accomplices, a courtesan, a lute player,
and the son of the Minister. The Minister got the King to release the
prisoners, and to take the Queen to the park wearing a necklace. When
she danced the monkey imitated her, and the necklace fell off its
neck.</p>
<p>With reference to the remarks of the prisoners in the Sinhalese
version, that being wealthy persons they could escape by paying the
value of the missing necklace, a statement not found in the J&#257;taka
story, Sirr, who was a Deputy Queen&rsquo;s Advocate in Ceylon, stated
in <i>Ceylon and the Cingalese</i> (1850), vol. ii., p. 231, that
&ldquo;theft was punished by a fine equal to the value of the stolen
property, by flogging, and by imprisonment; or, if the thief
immediately restored the property, he was only flogged and paraded
through the village where the crime had been committed.&rdquo;
According to Dr. Davy, flogging and imprisonment were not always
inflicted, however.</p>
<p>In the middle of the seventeenth century, according to <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e4559" title="Source: Ribiero">Ribeiro</span>, &ldquo;if
the thief confessed his crime he was condemned to pay the highest value
of the article which satisfied the other party, and as a penalty for
his offence double its value to the Royal Treasury&rdquo; (<i>History
of Ceil&atilde;o</i>, translation by Pieris, 2nd ed., p. 152).

<h2 class="main">The Widow Woman and Loku-Appuh&#257;mi</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a village a Si&#7789;i<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4573src" href="#xd27e4573" name="xd27e4573src">1</a> widow-mother
had a son having the name Appuh&#257;mi. That Loku-Appuh&#257;mi,
having seen that the men of that district are gambling, came to his
mother, and said, &ldquo;Mother, the men of this village are gambling.
Having cooked rice during the day time give me it, and a little money,
for me to go to gamble,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the woman says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, whence is there money for
us? You be quiet,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4581src" href=
"#xd27e4581" name="xd27e4581src">2</a> she said.</p>
<p>The boy having heard the mother&rsquo;s word, through being unable
to gamble went outside the house. When going, this boy saw that two men
having been at the cattle herd near a tamarind tree, went away. Having
seen them, this boy went there and looked; when he looked two sallis
(half-farthings) had fallen down there.</p>
<p>After that, this boy having taken the two sallis, said to his
mother, &ldquo;Mother, now then, cook and give me rice, to go to
gamble,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Hearing that, the old woman asked, &ldquo;Whence is there money for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the boy said, &ldquo;There were two sallis for me at the root
of the tamarind tree; they will do for me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, the widow-mother having cooked rice dust, gave it. The
boy having eaten the rice, went to the gambling place. Having gone, he
laid down those two sallis, and told the men to play. The men did not
play. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then a youth of that very sort having been there played for it. Then
for the two sallis yet two sallis came. Next, he wagered (<i>lit.</i>,
held) the whole four sallis. On that occasion, for those four sallis
yet four sallis came. In this manner he that day won a large
amount.</p>
<p>Having won and gone from there, on the following day, also, he came.
Having come, and when playing that day having lost the money, he played
also on credit. Having played on credit, after he went away, on the
following day those creditors, through ill-feeling for him, went in
order to ask for the debts.</p>
<p>When they were going, this boy they call Loku-Appuh&#257;mi was
colouring a cudgel in a good manner. Before that, he had said to his
mother,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4606src" href="#xd27e4606" name=
"xd27e4606src">3</a> &ldquo;At first when the men come, when I am
asking for betel and areka-nut, you remain silent, looking on. Then I
shall come and beat you [with this cudgel]; then fall down as though
you died. When I am calling you a second time, do you, having gone into
the house and dressed well, like a good-looking young girl, bring the
betel box,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Well then, she did in that manner. When he did it (<i>i.e.</i>,
struck her) the woman in that very way fell down. Having fallen, when
she was [there] that one (<i lang="si-latn">aray&#257;</i>) again
called her. Then [getting up and] dressing well [inside the house] like
a young girl, she takes a betel box. When [she was] coming, those men
who came to take the debts asked, &ldquo;What did you to your
mother?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>Then he says, &ldquo;I made her Tirihan,&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4620src" href="#xd27e4620" name="xd27e4620src">4</a> he said.
Having said it, the man went into the house.</p>
<p>After he went into the house these men who came to take the debt,
thinking, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! It is good for us also to make our
women Tirihan; we don&rsquo;t want this debt,&rdquo; and taking that
cudgel, bounded off.</p>
<p>When they were bounding off, that Loku-Appuh&#257;mi having quickly
(<i lang="si-latn">wijaha&#7789;a</i>) sprung out and called those
persons (<i lang="si-latn">arun&#7789;a</i>) says,
&ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! You are taking it; that is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>right. Beat seven persons, and put them into one
house (room), and remain without opening the door until the time when
seven days are going, [for them] to become Tirihan,&rdquo; he said.
Having heard him the party went.</p>
<p>Having gone, and having beaten seven persons, and put them into one
house, when they were there seven days blue-flies began to go over the
walls of the house. Then this party say, &ldquo;It is indeed because
they have become Tirihan that the blue-flies are going.&rdquo; Having
said [this] they looked; when they looked all had died.</p>
<p>After that, they came in order to seize Loku-Appuh&#257;mi. Having
come they seized him; seizing him, and having placed his arms behind
his back and tying him, they went to throw him into the river. Having
gone, there was a travellers&rsquo; shed near the river; having tied
him at the post of the travellers&rsquo; shed, those men went outside,
and went away [temporarily].</p>
<p>After they went, a Moorman, taking a drove of laden pack-bulls
(<i lang="si-latn">tavalama</i>), went near the travellers&rsquo; shed.
When going, having seen that man who is tied to the post, this Moorman
asks, &ldquo;Why, Loku-Appuh&#257;mi, are you caught and tied to that
tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&#275;! Tambi-elder-brother, because I have lumbago I am
tied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Loku-Appu, I also have lumbago.
Because of it, catch and tie me also to that tree,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Then Loku-Appu said, &ldquo;If so, unfasten me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Tambi having come, unfastened him. After he
unfastened him, Loku-Appuh&#257;mi having caught him, and placed him at
the tree, and tied him, went away, driving the drove of pack-bulls.</p>
<p>After he went, those men having come, when they looked he was the
Tambi. Then those men say, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Loku-Appuh&#257;mi
took the appearance of a Moorman!&rdquo; Having spoken together, and
seized that Moorman, they put him into the river and went away.</p>
<p>Then Loku-Appuh&#257;mi, taking that Moorman&rsquo;s drove of
pack-bulls, goes through the midst of those men&rsquo;s houses. When
[he was] going, a woman said to the men, &ldquo;Look <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>there! Loku Appuh&#257;mi who went to be thrown
into the river,&mdash;&#332;n&#805;! he is bringing a drove of
pack-bulls!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Then a man, being in the house, said, &ldquo;Strumpet, don&rsquo;t
thou tell lies.&rdquo; Scolding her in this manner, the man also came
out and looked; when he looked, in very truth (<i lang=
"si-latn">haebaewa&#7789;ama)</i> he is coming! After that, he asked,
&ldquo;Loku-Appuh&#257;mi, whence (<i lang="si-latn">kohendae</i>) are
you bringing that drove of pack-bulls and the goods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Loku-Appuh&#257;mi said, &ldquo;Having gone to the bottom of
the water in the river, when I looked these were [there]. After that,
having looked out a good one from them (<i>i.e.</i>, a good drove of
bulls), [after] selecting it I came away,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Having heard that word, the party, as many as stayed at home, said,
&ldquo;We also having gone there, put us into the river to bring an
excellent<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4676src" href="#xd27e4676" name=
"xd27e4676src">5</a> bit of pack-bull drove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; calling the party,
Loku-Appuh&#257;mi put a person into the water. Then, having gone into
the water, when dying he made a sound, &ldquo;Boka,
Boka,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4682src" href="#xd27e4682"
name="xd27e4682src">6</a> and dust came to the surface.</p>
<p>Then the party who stayed on the bank asked, &ldquo;What,
Loku-Appuh&#257;mi, is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loku-Appuh&#257;mi says, &ldquo;That is [because] he is finding
excellent droves of pack-bulls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the other persons, also, who were on the bank, said, &ldquo;If
so, put us in also, to select good droves of pack-bulls and
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he put that party in also. In that very way the whole of
the persons went and died in the river.</p>
<p>Loku-Appuh&#257;mi having returned, taking all the goods that were
in those persons&rsquo; houses, went to those persons&rsquo; houses.
Having gone, he became rich to a good degree (<i lang=

<p>There is also a Khassonka story of West Africa extremely like the
later incidents of No. 10, in <i lang="fr">Contes Soudanais</i> (C.
Monteil), p. 67. When his mother continually interrupted a young thief
who was being questioned by a King, the son stabbed her with his
dagger, in reality merely piercing a bottle of ox&rsquo;s blood which
was concealed under her cloth. She fell down, the blood poured out, and
she seemed to be dead. The son then, uttering spells, three times
sprinkled the deceased&rsquo;s face with a cow&rsquo;s tail dipped in
water. She recovered, and the son sold the cow&rsquo;s tail to the King
for two thousand slaves. When the King cut the throat of his favourite
wife and failed to restore her to life, he ordered the thief to be
thrown into the river sewn up in an ox-hide. While the slaves who
carried him left their bundle on the roadside, the thief, hearing the
voices of a pious Muhammadan priest and his pupils and servants, began
to cry out that he preferred a life on earth to one in Paradise. The
priest opened the skin, and learning that the youth was being forcibly
taken to Paradise, gladly exchanged places with him, and was drowned.
The thief then took some gold that he found in the priest&rsquo;s
house, and reported to the King that the King&rsquo;s father had sent
him with it for the King, adding that there was much more to be got in
Paradise. The King gave him half the gold, and got himself and his
relatives sewn up in hides and thrown into the deepest part of the
river. As they did not return the people made the thief King.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there is a Vedar&#257;la. The
Vedar&#257;la is a person possessing the knowledge of medical practice,
a very clever person at telling prognostics (<i lang="si-latn">nimiti
k&#299;men</i>). There is also a child of the
Vedar&#257;la&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>During the time while they are thus, the boy one day came running
near the Vedar&#257;la, and said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Father, you have
been learning so much; you are now dying. Now then, where is your
learning that you have taught me?&rdquo; and he began to cry.</p>
<p>After that, [the Vedar&#257;la] was not [sufficiently] conscious to
tell him anything. While he was about to die, just as he was saying,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Son, you will have the decoction of eight Nelli
[fruits]&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the Vedar&#257;la died.</p>
<p>He having died, after a little time went by, a man&rsquo;s yoke of
buffaloes were lost. After that, the man (<i lang=
"si-latn">minissa</i>) speaks, &ldquo;An&#275;! What shall I do? If the
Vedar&#257;la were [here], he would look at the prognostics [to
ascertain] on which hand the yoke of buffaloes went, and he would tell
me. It is indeed to our loss that the Vedar&#257;la is lost.&rdquo; In
that manner he spoke a word.</p>
<p>Then one man who was present said, &ldquo;Why are you saying thus?
That Vedar&#257;la&rsquo;s son is [there]. Go and look for him, and ask
it of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the man, having gone to the tree and plucked betel
leaves, came in the manner in which they came before near the big
Vedar&#257;la also, and having given betel leaves and money, asked that
boy, &ldquo;How, Vedar&#257;la, have my <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>yoke of buffaloes
been lost? On account of it you must look at the
prognostics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the boy said regarding it, &ldquo;Taking eight Nelli fruits,
beat them and pour water [over them]; and having made a decoction, and
made rock salt into powder, and put it in, and poured castor-oil in,
drink it, and go and seek the yoke of buffaloes. Then they will be
found,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Afterwards the man came home, and taking eight Nelli fruits, and
having beaten them, and poured water [on them], made a decoction; and
having made rock salt into powder, and put it in, and poured castor-oil
in, drank it in the morning, and went to seek the lost cattle.</p>
<p>When going a little far the man began to [experience the purgative
effect of the medicine in a severe manner]. As he was going in the
chena jungle he met with a pool. The man, washing his hands and feet at
the pool, and sitting at noon near a tree at the pool because of the
severity of the treatment, remained looking about.</p>
<p>While he was looking about for a little time, the yoke of buffaloes,
having stayed in that chena jungle and being thirsty, came there and
drank water from that pool. While they were drinking, the man went to
them, and catching the yoke of buffaloes, took them to the village.
Having gone [there] he ate rice, and the [action of the medicine]
ceased. On the following day, the man, tying up a pingo
(carrying-stick) load and going with it, gave many presents to the
Vedar&#257;la&rsquo;s boy.</p>
<p>When a little time had passed, war having been made on the King of
that country, and as still [another] King was coming to seize the
country, because there were not people [left] to fight the King was in
much fear.</p>
<p>While he was thus, that man whose cattle having been lost were
found, went and said, &ldquo;O Lord, Your Majesty, the
Vedar&#257;la&rsquo;s son, a small Vedar&#257;la indeed, somehow or
other having made a stratagem on account of that, will do something so
that they will not fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King having sent men, asked for a device for it. On
account of it, he said that everybody who was in the city should drink
the decoction of eight Nellis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123"
href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thereupon, all in the city having made the decoction, and put in the
rock salt and castor-oil, drank it that very night. Having drunk it,
the whole of the people having entered the city, while they were
sleeping all became [obliged] to go out. The men who stayed in the city
would be about a hundred.</p>
<p>At the city there is a small window at the back, called &ldquo;the
dark window&rdquo; (<i lang="si-latn">aendiri kawla</i>). From that
window each one began to go out ten or twelve times to the open
ground.</p>
<p>The King who was coming to the city for the war, had sent spies to
the city to look if [many] people are there. While the spies stayed
looking at this, it was like a wonder. If there was not one, there was
another went out until the time when it became light.</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;Leaving [out of consideration] the multitude who
went out, how many people are there not in the city still! This war
does not matter to us; because of it let us go away,&rdquo; all the men
whom the King sent went away. After that, having said, &ldquo;There are
too many people at this city,&rdquo; through fear he did not come for
the war.</p>
<p>After that, the King of this city having given to the
Vedar&#257;la&rsquo;s son many villages, fields, silver and gold,
established him in the post of Minister. Thereafter, having been a
soothsayer who bore a name just like that one&rsquo;s father, he was a
very wealthy person.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Prince and Princess and Two
D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257;s</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain time, in the [Sun] Rising world,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4788src" href="#xd27e4788" name="xd27e4788src">1</a>
a Prince was born. In the [Sun] Setting world<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4792src" href="#xd27e4792" name="xd27e4792src">2</a> a Princess
was born. When in the Rising world a D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257;, and in
the Setting world a D&#275;vat&#257;w&#299; were coming to hear
Ba&#7751;a (the Buddhist sacred writings), the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257;
saw the Prince and the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#299; saw the Princess. On
that day, the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; and the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#299;,
both of them, came later than on other days.</p>
<p>The D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; asked the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#299;,
&ldquo;Thou not having come<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4798src" href=
"#xd27e4798" name="xd27e4798src">3</a> at the time when thou camest on
other days, why hast thou delayed so much to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#299; said, &ldquo;I saw a Princess.
As there is not in this world a beautiful Princess who is equal to the
Princess, having stayed looking at the Princess I was
delayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; [said], &ldquo;Not like the
Princess whom thou sawest, I saw a Prince possessing beauty to the
degree which is not in this world. Because of it, having stayed looking
at the Prince, I delayed so much.&rdquo; Well then, the
D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; says, &ldquo;The Prince whom I saw is more
beautiful than the Princess whom thou sawest.&rdquo; The
D&#275;vat&#257;w&#299; says, &ldquo;The Princess whom I saw is more
beautiful than the Prince whom thou sawest.&rdquo; Having said [this],
the two had a quarrel there.</p>
<p>The D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; said, &ldquo;When it is the time the
Princess whom thou sawest is sleeping, for the purpose of looking if
the Princess&rsquo;s beauty is more or the Prince&rsquo;s beauty is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>more, taking her together with even her bed
while she is asleep, come thou to the place where this Prince
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accepting the word, the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#299; having brought the
Princess, deposited her together with even the bed, near the place
where the Prince has gone to sleep.</p>
<p>After that, the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; and D&#275;vat&#257;w&#299;
say, &ldquo;We will now test the beauty of these two thus,&rdquo; that
is, it was [settled] that when they have awakened these two from sleep,
the beauty is the less of the person who first salutes, honours, and
pays respects [to the other].</p>
<p>Well then, by the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; the Prince was awakened.
But the Prince [having seen the Princess] thinks, &ldquo;It will be a
thing that these parents of mine have done for the purpose of getting
to know my motives in not marrying.&rdquo; Having put on the
Princess&rsquo;s finger the jewelled ring that was on the
Prince&rsquo;s hand, and putting the jewelled ring that was on the
Princess&rsquo;s hand on the Prince&rsquo;s finger, not looking on that
side, having looked on the other side (<i>i.e.</i>, in another
direction) he went to sleep.</p>
<p>Thereafter awaking the Princess, she saluted and paid honours and
respects to the Prince. Still the quarrel of the
D&#275;vat&#257;w&#299; and D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; not being allayed,
for the purpose of looking which of their two words is right and which
wrong, they summoned another D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257;.</p>
<p>The D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; having come, says, &ldquo;Do not ye
allow this quarrel to occur; the two persons are of equal
beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; tells the
D&#275;vat&#257;w&#299;, &ldquo;Please bring the Princess to her city,
and place her [as before],&rdquo; he said. The D&#275;vat&#257;w&#299;
did so.</p>
<p>Afterwards, in the morning the Prince having arisen, not knowing
this wonder that had happened, with the thought that it was done by his
father the King, not eating, not drinking, he began to beg his father
the King, and the Ministers, to give him the Princess.</p>
<p>Thereupon, his father the King and the other persons, having
thought, &ldquo;Whence did we [bring and] place [there] this Princess
of whom we are told! Through a malady&rsquo;s causing this to this
Prince, he is babbling,&rdquo; began to apply medical treatment.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Princess, just like that, not eating, not drinking, began to beg
for the Prince whom the Princess saw. Therefore her parents, just like
that, to her also began to apply medical treatment. Vedar&#257;las
(doctors) having come, say, &ldquo;We are unable to cure this
malady.&rdquo; But one Vedar&#257;la said, &ldquo;I can cure this
malady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he asked the Prince about the malady, the Prince [said],
&ldquo;I have no malady at all; but not obtaining the Princess whom I
saw on the night of such and such a day is my malady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he asked, &ldquo;What mark of it have you, Sir?&rdquo; the
Prince said<span class="corr" id="xd27e4837" title="Source: .">,</span>
&ldquo;The ring that was on her hand,&mdash;look here, it is on my
hand; the ring that was on my hand is on <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e4840" title="Source: the">her</span> hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, the Ved&#257; says, &ldquo;In whatever country the
Princess is I will bring her. You, Sir, without troubling [yourself],
eat and drink, and be good enough to remain in pleasure.&rdquo;
Thereupon a very great delight was produced for the Prince; the malady
disappeared.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Ved&#257;, taking the ring that was on the
Prince&rsquo;s hand, and having gone from city to city successively,
entered into the very city at which she alighted. At that time, the
inhabitants of the city [said], &ldquo;Our King&rsquo;s daughter has a
malady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vedar&#257;la having heard it, when he asked, &ldquo;What manner
of illness is that malady?&rdquo; the inhabitants say,
&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Should I not obtain the Prince who was seen at
night by me, my life will be lost,&rsquo; the Princess says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Vedar&#257;la says, &ldquo;I am able to cure the
malady.&rdquo; [They informed the King accordingly.]</p>
<p>Thereupon the King having given (promised) him several great
offices, went summoning the Vedar&#257;la to the palace. Then the
Vedar&#257;la asks the Princess, &ldquo;What is the malady which has
come to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said it, &ldquo;Not obtaining the Prince whom I saw at
night, indeed, is my malady,&rdquo; she replied. Then when the Vedatema
(doctor) showed the ring that he took, with the quickness with which
she saw the ring the malady became cured. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p>Afterwards the Vedatema says [to the King], &ldquo;Even should this
malady be [apparently] cured in this manner, yet afterwards she may
behave arrogantly. Because of it, there is my Preceptor [whom I must
call in]. Having come with him, I must still apply medical treatment
for this malady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and
having given him presents and distinctions, allowed him to go. The
Vedar&#257;la having returned, went [back] with that Prince. After
that, the two persons saw and married each other.</p>
<p>When they had been [there] a little time, the two persons having
come away for the purpose of seeing the Prince&rsquo;s two parents,
when they were coming on the road, while she was sleeping near a river,
suffering from weariness, the mouth of the Princess&rsquo;s box of
ornaments having been opened by the Prince, he remained looking in it.
A talisman<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4863src" href="#xd27e4863" name=
"xd27e4863src">4</a> of the Princess&rsquo;s was there. A bird having
carried the talisman aloft, began to go away with it. Thereupon the
Prince began to go after the bird; after he had gone on a very distant
unfrequented road, it became jungly (<i lang="si-latn">walmat</i>), and
being unable to find the path [on which he had come], he went to
another city.</p>
<p>As the Princess was afraid to go to seek the quarter to which the
Prince went, putting on the Prince&rsquo;s clothes she went to another
city. Having gone to the city, when she went near the King, the King
asked what was the work she could do. This Princess says, &ldquo;I can
teach the arts and sciences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the King appointed the [apparent] Prince to teach the
Princesses, and when ships came from foreign countries to take charge
of them [and examine their cargoes],&mdash;all these things. And the
King, thinking this person is a Prince, married [to her] and gave her a
Princess of the King&rsquo;s. Afterwards, not concealing from the
Princess that she is a Princess, and the manner in which she is seeking
her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>husband the Prince, she told her not to make it
known; and she also concealed it in that very way.</p>
<p>The Prince, on the journey on which he went to seek the ornament,
having joined a man of another city, remained doing work for wages.
While he was in that condition, when two birds were fighting, one
having split open the stomach of the other threw it down. When the
Prince looked at it, the ornament that he sought having been [in it],
he met with it.</p>
<p>From the country in which is the Prince, ships go to the country in
which is the Princess. The gardener [under whom he worked] having
obtained and given goods to the Prince, the Prince, taking the
Princess&rsquo;s talisman and having put it in a box,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4888src" href="#xd27e4888" name="xd27e4888src">5</a> was about
to go [in a ship] for the sale of the goods. But a little before he was
coming away, they sent word that an illness had befallen the gardener,
and when he went to look [at him] the ships went away.</p>
<p>At that time the ships went to the other city. Afterwards, at the
time when [the Princess] was examining the goods of the ships she met
with this ornament. When she asked, &ldquo;Whose are these
goods?&rdquo; on their saying they were those of such and such a
gardener&rsquo;s labourer, she confiscated the goods until they brought
him.</p>
<p>Afterwards the sailors, having gone back, brought him. After that,
having caused him to bathe in scented sandal water, and [the King]
having appointed him to the sovereignty, marrying both the Princesses
he remained [there].</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This story is evidently that found in the <i>Arabian
Nights</i> (Lady Burton&rsquo;s ed., vol. 2, p. 307), and termed there
&ldquo;Tale of Kamar al-Zaman,&rdquo; although in some details it
adheres more closely to a story given in the <i lang=
"sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i>. In the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>, the father of the Prince was King of the Kh&#257;lid&#257;n
Islands&mdash;(stated to be the Canaries)&mdash;and the
Princess&rsquo;s father was the King of &ldquo;the Islands of the
Inland Sea in the parts of China.&rdquo; A Jinn Princess saw and
admired the Prince, who had been imprisoned for refusing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>to
marry; and an Ifrit saw the Princess, and by the order of the Jinn
Princess brought her while asleep (without the bed) and laid her beside
the sleeping Prince. At the suggestion of an Ifrit whom they summoned
to decide their dispute as to which was the more beautiful, they awoke
first the Prince and then, when he was asleep, the Princess, each of
whom took the other&rsquo;s finger ring. The Princess was then carried
back. Next day the two were thought to be insane, and they were kept in
prison for three years. The Princess&rsquo;s foster-brother found the
Prince, cured him by telling him about the Princess, and returned with
him. He visited the Princess disguised as an astrologer; she at once
recovered, and her father gave her in marriage to the Prince, as well
as the rule over half the kingdom. The rest of the story agrees closely
with that given above.</p>
<p>The <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. ii, p. 209, contains a story which seems to be the Indian original
of the first part of the tale. The second part relating to the loss and
recovery of the talisman, appears to be an evident addition, since the
first part is a complete tale by itself. The Indian story is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>At the orders of the God Ga&#7751;&#275;&#347;a, the Ga&#7751;as his
attendants transported Prince &#346;r&#299;dar&#347;ana of M&#257;lava
(without his bed), while asleep, to Hansadw&#299;pa, an island in the
Western Sea, and placed him on the bed on which the King&rsquo;s
daughter lay asleep. He awoke, thought it a dream, nudged her shoulder,
and she awoke. When they had exchanged ornaments, the Ga&#7751;as
<span class="corr" id="xd27e4924" title=
"Source: stupified">stupefied</span> them and carried back the Prince.
Next day the Prince&rsquo;s father, after hearing his story, issued a
proclamation, but could not discover where Hansadw&#299;pa was. The
Princess&rsquo;s father ascertained the facts by means of the power of
contemplation possessed by an ascetic, who went &ldquo;in a
moment&rdquo; by his mystical power to M&#257;lava, cured a madman by
the touch of his hand, and was requested to restore the Prince to
happiness. He carried him back to Hansadw&#299;pa, and after the two
lovers were married conveyed them both to M&#257;lava, where the Prince
eventually succeeded to the throne.</p>
<p>In <i>The Story of Madana K&#257;ma R&#257;ja</i>
(Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;), p. 29, a Prince by means of
a magic ring caused a Princess to be transported to him while asleep on
her bed. They agreed to be married, and he then sent her back to her
own room in the same way. On the following day she told her father that
she had dreamt of this Prince and had determined to marry him. A few
days afterwards the Prince&rsquo;s Ministers arrived to ask her hand in
marriage, and when the Prince went there they were married.</p>
<p>In <i>Folklore of the Santal Parganas</i> (Rev. Dr. Bodding), p.
299, a Prince who refused to marry was imprisoned by his father. Three
Bongas (deities) saw him, the wife of the Bonga chief proposed to give
him a bride, and during the next night he found a Bonga maiden sitting
beside him when he awoke. They exchanged rings, were seen by the
warders, who informed the R&#257;ja, and they were married.

<h2 class="main">Concerning the Prince and the Princess who was
Sold</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there was the son of a King. He
gave charge of him to a teacher, and told him to teach the son. On the
day on which he was handed over he was not there. On the following day,
only, having gone to the school, after that having said he was going to
school he went to the high road, and during the whole day-time<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4945src" href="#xd27e4945" name="xd27e4945src">1</a>
having been eating and eating kaju [nuts] in the evening he comes home
and says that he went to school. A single person does not know of this
deceit.</p>
<p>In this manner, while two or three years are going he did thus. The
teacher also did not give information to the King about this
matter.</p>
<p>He not giving it, one day the King to look into this Prince&rsquo;s
learning wrote a letter and placed it on the table. After that lying
Prince came, having said that he went to school, [the King], with the
view that &ldquo;If he was learning it is good for me to ascertain
easily by [means of] letters,&rdquo; said, &ldquo;Son, on that table
there is a letter. I omitted (<i lang="si-latn">baeri-wun&#257;</i>) to
look at it. Break it [open] and look what the letter is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince, having broken [open] the letter and looked at
it, said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Father, except that in this there are a sort
of strokes and strokes, and a sort of drops, I indeed cannot perceive
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King having become angry at the teacher sent him a letter.
The teacher having looked at the King&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>letter, sent a letter thus: &ldquo;An&#275;! O
King, except that you, Sir, handed over your son, I have not even yet
seen the Prince after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the King having said, &ldquo;We do not want the
disobedient son,&rdquo; caused the executioners to be brought, and
having said, &ldquo;Having taken him and gone into the midst of the
forest, you must behead him,&rdquo; gave him [to them].</p>
<p>At that time the Prince&rsquo;s Mother-Queen said to the
executioners, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill him&rdquo;; and having spoken to
them and given a hundred thousand masuran to the Prince, and said,
&ldquo;Without having come bounding into this country again, go you to
another country and get your livelihood,&rdquo; sent him away.</p>
<p>As the Prince was going away to another country, he saw that four
persons, holding a man who is dead, are dragging him to the four sides,
and he asked, &ldquo;An&#275;! You are tormenting that dead man!
Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the men [said], &ldquo;We four men are to get four hundred
masuran from this man. [For us] to let him go, will you give the four
hundred masuran?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>Thereupon this Prince, having seen the torment they were causing to
the dead body, said, &ldquo;It is good&rdquo;; and having given four
hundred masuran to the four men, and further having given five hundred
masuran, and caused the corpse to be buried, the Prince went away. That
dead man having gone, was [re]born, and became a fish in the sea.</p>
<p>When this Prince went from that city to another city, he saw that on
account of a want of money the King was selling a Princess and two
Princes of the King of the city; and this Prince having become inclined
to take that Princess asked the price for the Princess. The King said,
&ldquo;It is a thousand masuran.&rdquo; Then when the Prince looked at
the account of the masuran which he had, except that there were a
thousand masuran by account, there was not even one in excess.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4976src" href="#xd27e4976" name="xd27e4976src">2</a>
After that, having been considering and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>considering it, he
gave the thousand masuran, and taking the Princess, went away. That
this Prince is a royal Prince no one knows.</p>
<p>Then this Prince, calling the Princess also, went to a house at
which washermen stayed. The washermen asked, &ldquo;Where are ye
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Princess and Prince said, &ldquo;We are going to a
place where they give to eat and to wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the washermen, in order to take [them for] work for them, said,
&ldquo;It is good. If so, remain ye here.&rdquo; Thereupon the two
persons stayed there.</p>
<p>When they were [there] not much time, the washermen, thinking,
&ldquo;What are we giving to eat to these two for?&rdquo; said,
&ldquo;Go ye to any quarter ye want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time, the young Prince and Princess<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4991src" href="#xd27e4991" name="xd27e4991src">3</a> having gone
to yet [another] garden, building a stick house [there], this Prince
having told that Princess to be in the house went and plucked coconuts
during the whole day-time (<i lang="si-latn"><span class="corr" id=

Taking the coconuts given as his hire (<i lang=

the evening procuring two gills of rice and the requisite things for it
he comes back.</p>
<p>When he brought them, what does that Princess do? Each day she put
away at the rate of half a gill from the rice, and cooked the other
things; and having given to the Prince also, and the Princess also
having eaten, in this manner, when three or four days had gone, the
rice that she put away was collected [sufficient] for eating at still a
meal or two.</p>
<p>Then the Princess said to the Prince, &ldquo;Elder brother, [in
exchange] for the things you obtain to-day not getting anything [else],
bring a cubit of cloth, and thread, and a needle.&rdquo; Thereupon,
having given the coconuts obtained that day he brought a cubit of
cloth, and thread, and a needle.</p>
<p>After he brought them, having eaten and drunk in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>evening, and spread and given the mat for the
Prince to sleep on, what does this Princess do? Having cut the cubit of
cloth, and put sewing on it worth millions (<i lang=
"si-latn">k&#333;&#7789;i ganan</i>) of masuran, she sewed a
handkerchief. Having sewn it, and finished as it became light, she said
to that Prince, &ldquo;Elder brother, give this, and not stating a
price, asking for only what the shopkeeper gave [for such an article]
bring that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince, taking the handkerchief, went to three or four
shops. The shopkeepers said, &ldquo;We have no words [to say] regarding
taking that handkerchief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time there was still a great shop; to it he took it. The
shopkeepers, taking the handkerchief, having seen the marvel of it,
asked, &ldquo;For this handkerchief how much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this Prince said, &ldquo;I cannot state a price for that.
Please give the price that you give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the shopkeepers having said, &ldquo;Take as much rice and
vegetables as you can,&rdquo; after he got them gave also a hundred
thousand masuran.</p>
<p>This Prince taking them and having returned, those two persons
remained eating and drinking.</p>
<p>In those days the King who sold the Princess made a proclamation by
beat of tom-toms,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5031src" href="#xd27e5031"
name="xd27e5031src">4</a> that is, &ldquo;If there should be a person
who came [after] finding my Princess, having married the Princess to
him I will decorate him with the royal crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the King&rsquo;s Minister having said, &ldquo;I can come
[after] finding her; I want time for three months, and a handkerchief
that the Princess sewed,&rdquo; asked for [the handkerchief]. The King
gave it.</p>
<p>Then the Minister also having come by sea, landed at the city at
which this Princess and Prince stay. Having come there, he showed and
showed that <span class="corr" id="xd27e5040" title=
"Source: handkerhcief">handkerchief</span> at the shops, while asking,
&ldquo;Are there handkerchiefs of this kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shopkeepers who got that handkerchief said, &ldquo;Here; we have
one,&rdquo; and showed it.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Minister asked at the hand of the shopkeepers,
&ldquo;Who gave this handkerchief?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>The shopkeepers said, &ldquo;Behold. The man who stays at the house
in the lower part of that garden brought and gave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So having gone near the house, when he looked only the Princess was
[there], not the Prince. Having said at the hand of the Princess,
&ldquo;Your father the King said to you [that you are] to go with
me,&rdquo; he showed the handkerchief.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Princess said, &ldquo;No. It is not father who
provided subsistence for me for so much time. There is a person who
provided my livelihood. Because of it, unless I ask from him and go,
without [doing so] I will not go.&rdquo; At that time the Prince
came.</p>
<p>After he came this Princess said to the Prince, &ldquo;Elder
brother, my father the King having said that I am to go, has sent this
Minister. What do you say about it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;If you will go, go; if you will be [here],
stay. It is [according to] any wish of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princess spoke, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say so, elder brother.
Except that if you told me to stay I will stay, and if you told me to
go I will go, for the word of my father the King I will not go. Because
of it, let the whole three of us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince also having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; the
whole three having embarked began to go. While going thus, except that
the Princess and Prince remain on one side, and that Minister on one
side, they do not allow him to approach them. The Minister is much
annoyed about it.</p>
<p>They went six days on the sea. On the whole six days, having said
that the Minister will put into peril and kill the Prince, the Princess
without sleeping remains simply looking on when the Prince has gone to
sleep. In that way, on the seventh day after they embarked, the
Princess being sleepy could not bear up, and said to the Prince,
&ldquo;Elder brother, during the time while I sleep a little you remain
awake.&rdquo; Having said [this], the Princess went to sleep.</p>
<p>The Prince having been awake a little time, through the manner of
his reclining went to sleep. Thereupon this Minister having awoke, when
he looked having perceived that both were asleep, quickly rolled the
Prince into the sea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135"
name="pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>Just as he was thus rolling him over, that dead man having become a
fish and having been [there], came and seized him behind. Having thus
seized him, placing him on its back the fish asked at the hand of the
Prince, &ldquo;What will you give me to put you ashore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;I have not a thing to give now. From
the [first] things that I obtain afterwards I will give you a half
part.&rdquo; Thereupon the fish brought him and put him ashore.
Afterwards the Prince went to the Princess&rsquo;s city.</p>
<p>[Having landed], that Minister said to the Princess, &ldquo;Let us
go to the palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Princess said, &ldquo;I will not go with thee. Tell
thou my father to come.&rdquo; So the Minister having gone, told the
King to come.</p>
<p>Thereupon the King came. At that time that Prince also stayed near,
so that he should be visible to the Princess.</p>
<p>The Princess, having seen the Prince, asked, &ldquo;Father, in this
country how are the laws now regarding journeys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;What, daughter, are you saying that for? They
are just like [they were] when you were [here].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Princess said, &ldquo;At the time when you were
sending letters to me, my elder brother who gave me food and clothing,
and I, and the Minister, having embarked came away. My elder brother
who provided subsistence for me was lost. You must make inquiry about
it in a thorough manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King having made inquiry and looked [into the matter],
getting to know that the Minister threw him into the sea, [found that]
unless he beheads the Minister there was nothing else [to do]. Because
of it, he commanded them to behead the Minister. After that they
beheaded him.</p>
<p>Then, this Princess first marrying the Prince himself, he appointed
the Prince to the sovereignty.</p>
<p>Well then, when they are there no long time, the two persons went to
the sea to bathe. At that time that fish having come, seizing the
Prince&rsquo;s leg asked, &ldquo;Where is the charge you undertook for
me that day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Princess having heard it, asked, &ldquo;What does it
say?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince said, &ldquo;When I was falling into the sea
that day, this fish, taking me on its back, asked at my hand,
&lsquo;What will you give [me] to put you on shore?&rsquo; Then I said,
&lsquo;From the things that I obtain first I will give a [half]
share.&rsquo; That share it now asks for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time the Princess having given into the Prince&rsquo;s hand
the sword that was on the shore, said, &ldquo;It is I whom you obtained
first. Because of it, having split a [half] share off me give it to the
fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the fish said, &ldquo;No need of it for me. This Prince one day
has expended one thousand (<i>sic</i>) four hundred masuran over a dead
body. Please say you do not want that debt. [I was that dead
body].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince said, &ldquo;I do not want the debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the fish having completely let go went away. The
Prince-King and the Princess-Queen, both of them, [after] bathing came
to the palace.</p>

<p class="first">In the <i>Arabian Nights</i> (Lady Burton&rsquo;s ed.,
vol. v, p. 304), Princess Miriam, daughter of the King of France, who
had been in a vessel that was captured, was offered for sale in
Alexandria, and was bought by a youth for a thousand gold
d&#299;n&#257;rs (about &pound;500), all the money he had. Each night
she knitted a silk girdle, which he sold in the morning for twenty gold
d&#299;n&#257;rs. While he was wearing on his head a beautiful silk
handkerchief worked by her, the work was recognised by a Minister sent
by the French King in search of her. He bought it for a thousand
d&#299;n&#257;rs, and gave a feast at which he made the youth drunk and
induced him to sell the Princess for ten thousand d&#299;n&#257;rs; she
was carried back to France, and married to the Minister. After some
adventures while the youth was endeavouring to carry her off, the two
lovers escaped to Baghdad, and were formally married by the Khalif.
With her own hand she killed the Minister when he came to demand her
return to France.</p>
<p>Sir R. F. Burton agreed with Dr. Bacher that this story is based on
a legend of Charlemagne&rsquo;s daughter Emma and his secretary
Eginhardt (vol. vi, p. 290). Notwithstanding its resemblance to this
tale, the Sinhalese story may be an independent one. The account of the
Princess who works a jacket or scarf occurs in Nos. 8 and 248, in
which, also, the sale led to her abduction. In a variant, robbers
carried her off and sold her for a thousand <i>masu</i><span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a King and a Queen, it
is said. There is also a Prince (son) of those two persons. Having
given seven thousand masuran, a Princess was brought, and given to the
Prince by the King and Queen.</p>
<p>The Prince that night having spoken to the Princess, told her to
warm a little water and give him it. To that having said, &ldquo;I will
not,&rdquo; the Princess went to sleep. On that account, next morning
the Prince went and sent away the Princess.</p>
<p>After that, again having given seven thousand masuran, and brought
yet [another] Princess, they gave [her to him]. In that very way having
told that Princess to warm water, because she did not warm it he went
and sent her away. Thus in that manner having brought six Princesses,
because they did not warm water in the night he sent away the whole
six.</p>
<p>After that, having given ten thousand masuran, and come summoning
yet a Princess, they gave [her to him]. That Princess at the time when
the Prince told her, having warmed water gave it.</p>
<p>Well then, while he is causing the days to pass with much affection
for the Princess, the whole of the men of that country became ready to
go to Puttalam. This Prince also having thought of going, when he asked
[permission] at the hand of the King, the King and Queen, both of them,
said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go. If you eat the things that are here and
stop [here], it will be sufficient for you. They go to Puttalam near
the city of the courtesan woman. When they are going away from there
the courtesan woman catches <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href=
"#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>and takes them, having said,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t even go.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; They said many
things.</p>
<p>But the Prince without hearkening to it went away to Puttalam with
the men. Having gone, he went to the city of the courtesan woman. Then
certain men having been there, said, &ldquo;Here, indeed, is the
tavalam place<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5148src" href="#xd27e5148"
name="xd27e5148src">1</a>; throw down the sacks.&rdquo; Well then, this
party threw down the sacks.</p>
<p>Having thrown down the sacks, when they were becoming ready to cook,
the courtesan woman having come, said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you cook; I
am preparing food for all.&rdquo; The woman, however many persons
should come, gives food to the whole of them.</p>
<p>That night, also, having prepared food for these people, and called
them to the house, and apportioned the cooked rice and given it, she
said, &ldquo;Having eaten this cooked rice and eaten betel, should my
cat be holding the light at the time when it is becoming finished, this
multitude, the cattle, and the sacks are mine. Should it be unable [to
do] thus, my city, people, cattle, sacks, and all my goods are
yours,&rdquo; she wagered and promised.</p>
<p>This multitude having become pleased at it, began to eat the cooked
rice. When they began, the cat came, and sitting down in the midst of
the multitude remained holding the light. Having eaten both the cooked
rice and the betel, because at the time when they were finishing it
remained holding the light, the multitude, the cattle, the sacks,
became attached<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5160src" href="#xd27e5160"
name="xd27e5160src">2</a> to the courtesan woman (<i>i.e.</i>, became
her property).</p>
<p>This multitude being unable to go away, a number of years went by.
The Princess&rsquo;s parents having ascertained that that
Prince&rsquo;s Princess is living alone, without the Prince, the two
came to go away with the Princess. That King <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>and
Queen (the Prince&rsquo;s parents), having said that on the top of the
sorrow at the loss of the Prince they cannot send away the Princess
also, were much agitated. But the Princess&rsquo;s parents without
listening to it, joining with the Princess went to the Princess&rsquo;s
country.</p>
<p>Well then, the Princess, for the purpose of bringing the Prince,
spoke to the men of the Princess&rsquo;s country: &ldquo;Let us go to
Puttalam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men said, &ldquo;Having gone away to Puttalam, so many persons
were caught at the courtesan woman&rsquo;s city so many years ago; if,
again, we also go and should be caught, how shall we come back? We will
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Princess said, &ldquo;Without your becoming caught, I
will save you; without fear do you become ready to go with me.&rdquo;
After that, many persons got ready.</p>
<p>The Princess having cut a long bamboo stick, and cleaned it inside,
caught seven mice and put them in it; and having caught a few frogs and
put them in it for food for the mice, closed both ends and put a little
polish on the outside. The Princess having dressed in He&#7789;&#7789;i
dress, taking that staff made the name [for it], having said that the
name was &ldquo;tavalam staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, this He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la (the Princess) went away
to Puttalam with those many persons. Having gone, when they came to the
city of the courtesan woman, certain men having been [there] said,
&ldquo;Here, indeed, is the tavalama place; throw down the
sacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, having thrown down the sacks, when they were becoming
ready to cook, the courtesan woman came and said, &ldquo;I am preparing
food for you also; don&rsquo;t cook;&rdquo; and in the very manner [in
which she behaved] to that first party, gave rice and made the
promise.</p>
<p>When this party were eating cooked rice, the cat, sitting in the
midst of this party, is holding the lamp.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5190src" href="#xd27e5190" name="xd27e5190src">3</a> This
Princess who was the He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la, having opened one side
(end) of the tavalama staff, sent two mice to go near the cat&rsquo;s
head. The cat, not having even opened its eyes, did <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>not
look [at them]. This Princess sent still two mice. At that also it did
not awake and look; silently it remained holding the light. Then she
sent the other three mice. Instantly the cat, having let go the lamp,
sprang to catch the mice.</p>
<p>Well then, the city, the multitude of the city, the cattle, the
sacks, and the whole of the goods became the property of the Princess.
Well then, the Princess having told about this to the Princess&rsquo;s
Prince also, and having started off that party [who accompanied her] to
the Princess&rsquo;s country, the Prince and Princess went with the
party from the <span class="corr" id="xd27e5197" title=
"Source: Princes&rsquo;s">Prince&rsquo;s</span> country.</p>
<p>When they were coming along to the Prince&rsquo;s country, the
Prince&rsquo;s mother and the King too, remained weeping and weeping
under a tree in the rice field, wearing a sort of ugly clothes, the
hair of the head unfastened and hanging down, and mucus trickling down,
filthy to the extent that they could not look at them.</p>
<p>The Prince and Princess having seen from very far that these two are
[there], dressed themselves. But the two persons were unable to
recognise the Prince and Princess. Having come very near they asked the
King and Queen, &ldquo;What are you weeping there for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, the two say, &ldquo;There was only a single son of ours.
There is news that that son, having gone away to Puttalam, has been
caught at the courtesan woman&rsquo;s city. Now then, we have nobody;
because of it we are weeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon these two persons said, &ldquo;Well then, what shall we do
about that? Will you give us a resting-place in your kingdom?&rdquo;
they asked.</p>
<p>Then these two persons having said, &ldquo;We can,&rdquo; and having
gone summoning them to the palace, gave them the resting-place. This
Princess, taking off the He&#7789;&#7789;i clothes, and the Prince,
having put on other clothes in such a manner that they can recognise
them, and having summoned the King and Queen, the Princess told all
this account from the top to the root, and having said, &ldquo;Behold!
Your Prince is [here],&rdquo; she handed him over to them.</p>
<p>Thereupon, this King and Queen having prepared sandal <span class=

Princess to bathe in it, gave charge of the King&rsquo;s kingdom to the
Princess; and in that very palace these four persons passed the time in
a good manner.</p>

<p class="first">In <i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i> (Knowles), 2nd ed., p.
149, a woman who kept a gambling house was accustomed to win from
everyone by the aid of her cat, which brushed against the lamp and
extinguished it when the play was going against her. A young woman
whose husband had in this way lost everything he possessed, and who had
lost his liberty also, went in search of him, bribed the servants to
tell her the secret of the gambling woman&rsquo;s success, and then
went to play disguised as a man, having a mouse concealed in her
sleeve. When the cat approached the lamp she released the mouse, which
was chased by the cat. In the meantime she won back all that her
husband lost.</p>
<p>In <i>Folklore of the Santal Parganas</i> (collected by Dr.
Bodding), p. 115, a Prince while travelling was robbed of all his
belongings by a R&#257;ja, and became a labourer. His wife, hearing of
it, went to the same place, and it was settled that the person towards
whom the R&#257;ja&rsquo;s cat jumped should possess the wealth taken
from the Prince. The Princess had taken a mouse with her, and kept
partly uncovering it and covering it again with her shawl. When the cat
was released it sprang towards her to seize the mouse, so she regained
the property.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Tibet</i> (O&rsquo;Connor), p. 39, a young man
bet a person at whose house he halted that when it became night a cat
would not carry a lantern into the room. Each person wagered all his
property. The landlord&rsquo;s cat being trained to bring in the
lantern, he won the wager, and the man became his servant. His wife
came in search of him disguised as a man. She made the usual bet, got
her husband to conceal in his bosom a box containing three mice, and to
release these in turn when the cat approached. The cat allowed the
first two to run off, but dropped the lantern and chased the last one.
The man and his wife returned home with all the landlord&rsquo;s goods
as well as their own. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href=

young younger brother. Those seven elder brothers said to the younger
brother, &ldquo;Younger brother, you must bring a wife for yourself. In
that way having eaten a meal from that house and a meal from this
house, you cannot end [your] existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the younger brother said, &ldquo;I indeed at any time whatever
will not bring a wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the elder brother said to the younger brother, pushing
him, &ldquo;If so, remain looking out in order to call [in marriage]
the Maehiyall&#275;-gama Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the younger brother, having said, &ldquo;It is so
indeed,&rdquo; tied a ladder in order to go to Maehiyall&#275;-gama.
When he had gone along the ladder a considerable distance, having
fallen from the ladder to the ground the Prince went into dust
(<i lang="si-latn">kuduwel&#257; giy&#257;</i>).</p>
<p>After that, having come from the city Awulpura, they picked up the
bits into which the Prince was smashed; having come from the great city
Handi they joined them together; having come from Upadd&#257; city they
caused the Prince to be [re]-born.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5259src"
href="#xd27e5259" name="xd27e5259src">1</a></p>
<p>After that, the Prince went to Maehiyall&#275;-gama. When he went
there, the Princess having gone to bathe, only the servants were at the
palace. The servants having gone, said to the Princess, &ldquo;Some one
or other has come to our palace.&rdquo; Then the Princess told them to
give him a mat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>at the calf-house. The servants having given him
a mat at the calf-house, he did not sit down.</p>
<p>Again the servants went and said at the hand of the Princess,
&ldquo;He did not sit down.&rdquo; After that, the Princess told them
to give him a mat at the man&#774;&#7693;uwa (open shed). The servants
gave a mat at the shed.</p>
<p>The Prince did not sit down.</p>
<p>Again the servants went and said at the hand of the Princess,
&ldquo;He did not sit down.&rdquo; Then the Princess told them to
spread a mat inside the palace and give it. The servants spread a mat
inside the palace, and gave it.</p>
<p>The Prince did not sit down.</p>
<p>The servants again having gone, said at the hand of the Princess,
&ldquo;He did not sit down.&rdquo; Then the Princess told them to give
him a chair. Afterwards the servants gave a chair.</p>
<p>The Prince did not sit down.</p>
<p>The servants again went and said at the hand of the Princess,
&ldquo;He did not sit down.&rdquo; The Princess told them to give him a
couch. Afterwards the servants gave a couch.</p>
<p>The Prince did not sit down.</p>
<p>The servants went and said at the hand of the Princess, &ldquo;Then,
also, he did not sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Princess said, &ldquo;Give the couch on which I
recline, if so.&rdquo; The servants gave the couch on which the
Princess reclines.</p>
<p>After that, the Prince sat down.</p>
<p>Then the Princess, also, [after] bathing came to the palace. Having
come, the Princess said at the hand of the servants, &ldquo;To that
person who has come give food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the servants asked at the hand of the Princess, &ldquo;In what
shall we give the cooked rice?&rdquo; Then the Princess told them to
give pieces of leaf. Afterwards the servants having put the cooked rice
on pieces of leaf gave him it.</p>
<p>The Prince did not eat.</p>
<p>After that, the servants said at the hand of the Princess, &ldquo;He
does not eat.&rdquo; Then the Princess told them to put it on a plate
and give it. The servants having put it on a plate gave it.</p>
<p>He did not eat. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144"
name="pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>The servants said at the hand of the Princess, &ldquo;He did not
eat.&rdquo; Afterwards the Princess said, &ldquo;If so, put the plate
upon the betel tray and give it.&rdquo; The servants having put the
plate upon the betel tray, gave it.</p>
<p>The Prince did not eat.</p>
<p>Again the servants said at the hand of the Princess, &ldquo;Then,
also, he did not eat.&rdquo; Afterwards the Princess said, &ldquo;Put
it on my golden dish and give it.&rdquo; The servants, having put it on
the Princess&rsquo;s golden dish, gave it.</p>
<p>The Prince ate.</p>
<p>After that, the Princess having come near the Prince, asked,
&ldquo;What is He?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5323src" href=
"#xd27e5323" name="xd27e5323src">2</a> A Yak&#257;, or a
Deity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;I am neither a Yak&#257; nor a Deity; a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princess asked, &ldquo;For what matter has He Himself come
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;To marry the Princess; I for no other
business whatever have come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;If so, stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Princess marrying the Prince, when he was there for
a considerable time the Prince said, &ldquo;I must go to our city and
come back.&rdquo; Then the Princess said, &ldquo;I also must
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince having said, &ldquo;H&#257;, it is good; let us
go,&rdquo; the two went to the Prince&rsquo;s city. Near the city there
is a well; near the well there is a tree. Having caused the Princess to
stay in the tree, the Prince went into the city to bring a horse for
the Princess to go to the city.</p>
<p>After he went there, a woman of the smiths&rsquo; caste (<i lang=
"si-latn">&#257;ciri g&#257;eni</i>) came to the well for water. Having
come, when the smith woman looked in the direction of the well, the
reflection of the Princess who was in the tree appears in the well. She
saw the figure, the smith woman.</p>
<p>Having seen it, the woman thought it was the woman&rsquo;s [own]
figure, and having seen the beauty of it, thought,
&ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! I am such a good looking woman as this! Why came
I for water?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145"
name="pb145">145</a>]</span></p>
<p>When she looked up the tree she saw that the Princess is [there],
and the smith woman says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Having descended, please
bathe with a little water [that I will draw for you]. Why are you
there?&rdquo; The Princess remained there without descending.</p>
<p>The smith woman once more said, &ldquo;Please descend.&rdquo;
Afterwards, the Princess having descended, and taken off her clothes,
while she was bathing the smith woman said, &ldquo;Please bend down for
me to rub your back.&rdquo; The Princess bent down. Then the smith
woman raised her and threw her into the well.</p>
<p>The Princess was unable to come to the ground. The smith woman,
putting on the clothes of the Princess, climbed up the tree.</p>
<p>Then the Prince having come there bringing a horse, the Prince
stopped, and thinking that the smith woman was the Princess, told the
smith woman to descend; and the Prince and the smith woman went to the
city on the horse.</p>
<p>Then a blind man came near the well for water. The Princess, being
in the well, said, &ldquo;Having torn the cloth of the person who came
for water, and knotted the pieces together, put it into the
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, having torn the blind man&rsquo;s cloth, he put it into
the well. Seizing it, the Princess came to the ground; and making clear
the two eyes of the blind man, she went with the blind man [? to her
palace].</p>

<h2 class="main">The Wicked Princess</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a country there was a King; the King had a Prince
(son). He sent the Prince to a school to learn the arts, and the Prince
quickly learnt the arts. The teacher, having become pleased with the
Prince, gave his daughter in marriage to the Prince. When they were
thus for no long time the Prince&rsquo;s father, the King, died.</p>
<p>At that time he set out to go back with the Princess to his own
country. When going, they were obliged to go through the middle of a
forest on the path on which they were going.</p>
<p>In the midst of the forest there was a Vaedda King. The Vaedda King
having seen this Princess and Prince, asked, &ldquo;Who are you? To go
where, came you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince says, &ldquo;I indeed am the Prince called
M&#257;nam, of the King here; this is my Princess,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good. Who gave you permission to go through the middle
of this forest of mine? Owing to your coming without permission, I
shall now kill you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Otherwise, if you wish to go
to your kingdom, having now made this Princess remain here, you may
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince says, &ldquo;I will not go, leaving here my Princess whom
I married in my youth. If you will not let us go, it will be better
that we two should die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had said this, the Vaedda King, although he spoke about it
again and again, did not listen to him. Afterwards, having caused his
army to be brought, &ldquo;Look now at this army of mine,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;they will kill you. Then you will not have your kingdom,
nor your Princess. Obtaining your kingdom will be better than that,
having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>caused your Princess to remain here, and having
gone, saving your life,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;My kingdom does not matter to me if
there be not my Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good. If so, look, now, in a little [time], at the way
I shall kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My army! Come. Kill this Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Vaedd&#257;s came running, bringing bows and arrows. The
Prince having said to the Princess, &ldquo;You sit down. Look at what I
do to these Vaedd&#257;s. Don&rsquo;t cry. The favour of the Gods is
for us,&rdquo; taking his bow, fights with the army of the Vaedda King.
Having said, &ldquo;Shoot! Kill the Prince!&rdquo; all came, and sprang
[forward], and began to shoot. The Prince having given his sword into
the hand of his very Princess, taking the bow began to shoot at
them.</p>
<p>Well then, all having fallen, a few persons, only, being left over,
they bounded off and went away.</p>
<p>At that time the Vaedda King said, &ldquo;Is He<a class="noteref"
id="n147.1src" href="#n147.1" name="n147.1src">1</a> a great clever
one! What of my army&rsquo;s inability! I will not allow Him<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n147.1">1</a> to take the Princess and go. Come
to fight,&mdash;we two persons;&rdquo; and he called him.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince, after he (the Vaedda King) took his bow, says,
&ldquo;Not in that way. We two having wrestled, must cut off the head
of the person who should fall,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good. I am satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, come. Princess, take this sword of mine,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>At that time, the Vaedd&#257; having looked in the direction of the
Princess, and having spoken [to her] without the Prince&rsquo;s
knowing, the Princess was mentally bound to the Vaedda King. He had no
beauty,&mdash;a very black colour. The Prince was a very beautiful
person.</p>
<p>Well then, while they were wrestling, the Vaedda King having got
underneath, fell. Then the Prince asked the Princess for the sword. The
Princess quickly having given <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148"
href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>the sheath of the sword to
the Prince, gave the sword blade to the Vaedda King. Well then, the
Vaedda King cut the Prince&rsquo;s neck with the sword blade. The
Prince died.</p>
<p>The Princess says, &ldquo;Good work! That indeed was in my mind. Now
then, there is no fear; we can remain,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The Vaedda King says, &ldquo;You are very good. If you were not
[here] to-day, no life for me. Owing to your faithfulness, indeed, I
survive. Having taken off your clothes, and the tied things (belt,
bracelets, necklace, etc.) and ornaments, give them into my hand, in
order to place them on the [other] bank of that river, and come
back,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Seizing them, and having taken them and placed them somewhere, and
returned [he said], &ldquo;Let us go; we have not any fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking her to the middle of the river, he said, &ldquo;Throughout
this world there is not an evil bad woman like you.&rdquo; Having said,
&ldquo;It is bad [even] to remain in the country in which is the woman
who gave the sword sheath, in order to kill outright the Prince whom
you married while young,&mdash;having tied your mind on me whom you saw
to-day [only],&rdquo; having said this, he bounded off and went
away.</p>
<p>Her ornaments and her clothes having been lost, without even a place
to go to for food or clothing, while she was on the bank of the river
in the midst of the forest, a Jackal came running to the place where
the Princess was staying, holding in his mouth a piece of meat.</p>
<p>Having come there [and seen the reflection of the meat in the
water], he placed the piece of meat on the ground, and sprang to
<span class="corr" id="xd27e5447" title="Source: sieze">seize</span> a
piece of meat that was inside the river.</p>
<p>Then a kite that was flying above, having come, flew away, taking
the piece of meat.</p>
<p>The Princess having been looking on at it, says, &ldquo;Bola!
Foolish Jackal! Putting aside the piece of meat that was in thy mouth,
thou wentest to eat meat in the river! Was that good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After she had scolded him, the Jackal says, &ldquo;Not like my
foolishness was yours. Having been staying married to the King here,
having indeed gone to be married to the Vaedda <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>King
seen [by you] at that very instant, now you are staying in that way,
without even to eat or to wear, or even a place to go to. It is thou
thyself hast done foolishness more than I.&rdquo; Having said this, and
scolded her well, he went away.</p>
<p>Afterwards the God &#346;akra having come, taking a Jackal&rsquo;s
disguise, because of the wickedness which the Princess did, bit her and
tore her to pieces.</p>
<p>(According to a variant related by a Washerman she joined a poor man
and went about with him, getting a living by begging, until she
died.)</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In <i>The Orientalist</i>, vol. i, p. 184, this story
was given by Mr. H. A. Pieris, extracted from a dramatic work called
<i lang="si-latn">Kolan-kavi-pota</i>. A King named Maname and his
Queen while on a hunting excursion lost their way in the forest. The
Vaedda King stopped them, but offered to release the King if he would
hand over the Queen. The King refused, they fought, and the Vaedda King
got him down. Maname asked the Queen for his sword; but as she had
fallen in love with the handsome Vaedd&#257; she held out the sheath,
and when the King seized it drew out the sword and gave it to the
Vaedd&#257;, who cut off the King&rsquo;s head. Afterwards the
Vaedd&#257; made off with her jewels and clothes at the river. While
she sat there, &#346;akra appeared in the form of a fox (jackal),
holding a piece of meat, M&#257;tali as a hawk, and another d&#275;va
[Pa&ntilde;ca&#347;ikka] as a fish. The jackal dropped its meat on the
bank, and plunged into the water to seize the fish as it swam by; the
hawk then carried off the piece of meat. The Queen remarked on the
stupidity of the jackal, which replied that her folly was greater than
his; and she died of a broken heart when she realised it. This story is
simply the J&#257;taka tale No. 374 (vol. iii, p. 145), except that in
the J&#257;taka the woman is not described as dying or being
killed.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="fr">Aventures de Param&#257;rta</i> of the
Abb&eacute; Dubois, a dog which had stolen a leg of mutton in a
village, while crossing a river with it observed its reflection in the
water, let go its own mutton, and sprang to seize that of the other
dog, of course losing both.</p>
<p>In the <i>Tot&#257; Kah&#257;n&#299;</i> (Small), p. 81, a young
married woman eloped with a stranger one night, and while near a pond
he stole her jewels when she was asleep. In the morning a jackal came
up, carrying a bone. Seeing a fish that had fallen on the bank, it
dropped the bone and rushed to catch the fish, which floundered into
the water. In the meantime the bone was carried off by a dog. The woman
laughed, quoted a proverb, &ldquo;He who leaves the half to run
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>after the whole, gets neither the whole nor the
half,&rdquo; and told the jackal her story. It recommended her to
return home shamming insanity; she did this, and allayed suspicion by
it.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. ii, p. 76, a fool who went to drink water at a tank saw in it the
reflection of a golden-crested bird that was sitting on a tree.
Thinking it was real gold, he entered the water several times to get
it, but the movement of the surface caused it to disappear each time.
In Julien&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Les Avad&#257;nas</i> this story is No.
XLVI, vol. i, p. 171; in this tale the man saw the reflection of a
piece of gold which the bird had placed in the tree.</p>
<p>In the Preface to <i>The Kath&#257;ko&ccedil;a</i>, p. xvii, Mr.
Tawney quoted from Professor Jacobi&rsquo;s introduction to the
<i lang="sa-latn">Pari&#347;ish&#7789;a Parvan</i> the Jain form of the
story, in which the robber left the Queen without clothing on the river
bank. The Vyantara god, in order to save her soul, took the form of a
jackal carrying a piece of flesh. When he dropped it and rushed to
seize a fish that sprang on the bank, a bird carried off the meat. The
Queen laughed, the jackal retorted, exhorted her to take refuge in the
Jina, and she became a nun.</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Les Avad&#257;nas</i> (Julien), No. LXXV, vol. ii,
p. 11, a woman eloped with her lover, who carried her gold, silver, and
clothes across a river and abandoned her. A fox which had caught a
sparrow-hawk came up, let go the hawk in order to spring at a fish in
the river, and lost both. When the woman remarked on his stupidity, the
fox admitted it, and retorted that hers was still greater. This is the
form in which the story occurs in <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents Contes et
Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol. i, p. 381; but in vol. ii, p. 367,
there is a variant which agrees with the following Tibetan tale.</p>
<p>In A. von Schiefner&rsquo;s <i>Tibetan Tales</i> (Ralston), p. 232,
a robber chief for whom a woman abandoned a blind man, sent her first
into the river and then made off with her things. A jackal which came
with a piece of flesh dropped it in order to seize a fish on the bank;
this sprang into the water, and a vulture carried away the meat. After
the usual retorts, the jackal agreed to assist her on her promising it
meat daily, told her to stand in the water immersed to the neck, and
persuaded the King whose wife she had been to pardon her on account of
this penance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=

<p class="first">A certain King had a very beautiful Princess
(daughter). With much affection he sent the Princess to school. Having
sent her, during the time while she was learning, the teacher who was
instructing her asked this Princess, &ldquo;Princess, wilt thou come to
marry me?&rdquo; Thereupon, the Princess because he was her teacher did
not scold him, and did not say, &ldquo;It is good&rdquo;; from that day
she stopped going to school.</p>
<p>At that time the Princess arrived at maturity. Because that teacher
was also the astrologer (<i lang="si-latn">naekatr&#257;la</i>), the
King went near him to ask about the <i lang="si-latn">naekata</i>
(prognostics depending on the positions of the planets) for her
arriving at maturity.</p>
<p>When he went, the teacher, in order to marry the Princess to
himself, said on account of the manner in which she arrived at
maturity, &ldquo;Should you keep this Princess in this city, this city
will become desolate throughout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time, the King, the father of this Princess, having heard
that word, becoming afraid, prepared a little ship; and having put food
inside the ship, and put in the Princess, and spread the sails, and
gone down to the mouth of the river, sent her away.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e5537src" href="#xd27e5537" name="xd27e5537src">1</a></p>
<p>Thereupon, that ship having gone, descended near yet a city. At that
time, the ship was visible to the King of that city. Having been seen
by him, he told the Minister to look at it and return. Then the
Minister having gone, when he looked a Princess of beauty such as could
not be seen [elsewhere] was inside the ship. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>In order that the Minister might marry the Princess, he went to the
King, and said, &ldquo;O Lord, Your Majesty, a leopardess is coming in
the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the King having said, &ldquo;It is good. If so, let us go
to look at the leopardess,&rdquo; set off.</p>
<p>Then the Minister, because the Minister&rsquo;s lie is coming to
light, having gone to the road, said at the hand of the King, &ldquo;O
Lord, Your Majesty, I did not say it in the midst of your multitude.
What though I said leopardess! It is a Princess who is wonderful to
look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King taking that speech for the truth, having gone, when he
looked it was a good-looking Princess. Then the King having asked the
Princess regarding the circumstances, came back, summoning her to the
palace, and married her.</p>
<p>When she was there a little time a Prince was born. Having been
born, during the time while he was there, that teacher who had imposed
[on the King], in much grief wrote false letters to the whole of the
various cities that her father the King was very unwell, and that
having seen the letter she was to come speedily; and he sent the
letters.</p>
<p>The King who had married this Princess having received the letter
and looked at the letter, told the Princess. Because a King does not go
to yet [another] city, he told the Princess to go with the army and
Minister, and come back, and started off the Princess-Queen to go to
the city at which is her father the King.</p>
<p>Thereupon, at the time when the Queen, carrying that Prince, was
going with the Minister on the sea, the Minister said thus to the
Queen, &ldquo;O Queen, now then, that King does not matter to us.
Because of it, let us go to another city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Queen, at the time when they were going ashore, said thus,
&ldquo;Why do you speak in that manner in the company of that crowd? We
are now going ashore; when we have gone ashore let us go somewhere or
other,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The Minister said, &ldquo;It is good.&rdquo; Having come ashore and
said, &ldquo;Let us go to another city,&rdquo; and gone a little far,
the Queen gave into the Minister&rsquo;s hand the Prince, and having
said, &ldquo;I will go aside and return,&rdquo; went and hid herself.
Having hidden herself, and gone into a tree on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>which are many leaves, she remained looking in
the direction of this Minister. When he had been looking out for a
considerable time, she remained there looking on, and said, &ldquo;When
I am not [there], he will put down the Prince and go; then having gone
there I will go away, carrying the Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she was looking, the Minister, having called the Queen,
because she was lost took the Prince by both legs, and having split
him, and thrown him into the sea, he sought the Queen. He could not
find her.</p>
<p>After that, this Minister went away. Having gone, he said to the
King of the city, &ldquo;The Queen got hid, and went off with another
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Queen thinking, &ldquo;What is it that he has killed that
Prince! My womb has not become barren,&rdquo; descended from the tree,
and having gone through the chena jungle to a cemetery at another city,
came out into the open ground. Having come out, when she looked about a
daughter of a Moorman (a resident of Arab descent) having died, he came
near the grave in which she was buried, and saying and saying,
&ldquo;Arise, daughter; arise, daughter,&rdquo; the man was weeping and
weeping.</p>
<p>This Queen trickishly having stayed looking at it, and thinking,
&ldquo;It is good. This Moorman will come to-morrow also, and will weep
here. Then, having been lying at the grave, when he is calling I will
get up,&rdquo; remained hidden there. After the man went away, she
scraped away a little earth on the grave, and at the time when the man
was coming she remained lying there.</p>
<p>The man having come, when he was calling, &ldquo;Arise,
daughter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;What is it, father?&rdquo; and arose.
Thereupon, the man having put on the face cloth,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5574src" href="#xd27e5574" name="xd27e5574src">2</a> closing her
to the extent that [her face] should not be visible to anyone whatever,
took her to the man&rsquo;s house, and placed her on the floor of the
upper story. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>That Minister having gone back, and said that the Queen went off, at
the very time when he was saying it, it caused the young younger
brother of the King to seek the Queen, and he came away [for the
purpose].</p>
<p>Having come away, and come seeking her through the whole of the
various cities, and come also to the city at which is this Queen, while
he was walking [through it] this Queen, who was on the floor of the
upper story, saw him, and waved her hand to the Prince, and causing him
to be brought, wrote a letter and threw it below from upstairs.</p>
<p>The Prince taking the letter, when he looked at it she said [in it]
that the danger which had occurred to her was thus. [It continued],
&ldquo;Because of it, to-day night having brought a horse to such and
such a place, and put on it two saddles, and made ready for both you
and me to go off, come and speak to me.&rdquo; So the Prince having
made ready in that very manner, came at night, and [leaving the horse
went near, and] spoke to the Queen.</p>
<p>Then the Queen, having descended from the floor of the upper room,
and come running by another path, a man of the city who walks about at
night, called Holman Piss&#257;, was [there]. The man met her
first.</p>
<p>After that, having gone holding the man&rsquo;s hand, sitting on the
back of the horse she gave him the whip, and told him to drive it along
a good path. At that time, that <span class="corr" id="xd27e5591"
title="Source: Solman">Holman</span> Piss&#257;, owing to his
insanity,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5594src" href="#xd27e5594" name=
"xd27e5594src">3</a> turned down a bye-path without speaking at all,
and driving the horse they began to go away. As he was going driving
it, it became light. There when the Queen looked the man was a
madman.</p>
<p>In order to come away and save herself from the man, she said,
&ldquo;It is good. Now then, we two must get a living. Because of it,
go and bring water for cooking.&rdquo; The madman having said,
&ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; went for water.</p>
<p>Thereupon this Queen having bounded off, went along in the chena
jungle, and came out (<i lang="si-latn">eli-baess&#257;</i>) at another
city.</p>
<p>Then this <span class="corr" id="xd27e5614" title=
"Source: Solman">Holman</span> Piss&#257; having come bringing water,
when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>he looked the Queen was not [there]. Because of
it, he said, &ldquo;An&#275;! If there is not my piece of gold what
should I stay for?&rdquo; and began to seek her. At that time, the
teacher, and the King, and the Minister, and the King&rsquo;s son, and
the Moorman, and Holman Piss&#257; were seeking her.</p>
<p>After that, this Queen having got hid in the chena jungle of the
city to which she went, while she remained there looking out, she saw
that an Arab having died they are bringing him to bury.</p>
<p>Having buried the Arab, after they went away this Queen broke open
the grave, and taking all the few Arab clothes, dressed in the Arab
trousers and put on the Arab jacket. Tying on the turban,&mdash;there
was an axe&mdash;hanging it on her shoulder, she went to the Arab shops
at the city, and practising the means of livelihood which that party
were practising, she stayed [there] a little time.</p>
<p>The younger brother of that King having gone to his village, while
he was there the King of the city died, and there being no one for the
sovereignty, they decorated the tusk elephant and sent it [in search of
a King]. At that time, the tusk elephant having gone, kneeled down near
that Arab Queen. After that, they appointed the Arab Queen to the
sovereignty, and she remained there. She issued commands in such a way
that to either the place where she bathes or the place where she
sleeps, no one whatever could come.</p>
<p>When she was there in that manner no long time, the city King who
had first married her, having shot (with an arrow) a deer, when he was
coming bounding along was unable to catch the deer. The Queen&rsquo;s
father, the King, taking dogs and having gone hunting, while he was
there this King&rsquo;s dogs having seen the deer, they also began to
chase the deer along the path. While they were coming chasing it, they
came to the city at which this Arab Queen is staying. At that time, the
people of the city having shot the deer, killed it.</p>
<p>After it died, the three parties began to institute law-suits. The
King who had married the Arab Queen says, &ldquo;If I had not shot it,
how would your dogs chase it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King, the Arab Queen&rsquo;s father, says, &ldquo;If there had
not been my dogs, how would you catch the deer?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>The men of this city say, &ldquo;If we had not killed it, how would
you kill the deer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, as they were unable to settle it, they came for the
law-suit, near the Arab King (Queen). That King having explained the
law-suit, and said that it belonged to the whole three parties, ended
the law-suit.</p>
<p>None whatever of those parties was able to recognise this Queen yet;
the Queen recognised all. Recognising them, she said, &ldquo;Nobody of
you can go away; I must give you an eating (<i lang=
"si-latn">k&aelig;&#772;mak</i>).&rdquo; Having said [this] she caused
all to remain.</p>
<p>Having stopped them, the Queen went away and dressed in
woman&rsquo;s clothes, and having returned, asked, &ldquo;Can you
recognise me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all the party asked her about the matters. The Queen having
told them the manner in which all had occurred, caused that Moorman to
be brought, and gave him presents. In addition, having caused Holman
Piss&#257; to be brought, she gave him to eat and drink. To the teacher
because he taught her letters she did nothing. To the King&rsquo;s
younger brother she gave very great presents and wealth.</p>
<p>Because that Minister, having seized both the legs of the [baby]
Prince, had split him in two, having taken the Minister to the place
where there are two Palmira trees, and brought the [tops of the] trees
together at one place, and tied an arm and leg, and an arm and leg to
each of the two trees, they let go the two trees. At that time, in the
very way he split that Prince he was split in two.</p>
<p>After that, just as before, she remained exercising the sovereignty
in a thorough manner.</p>

<h2 class="main">Concerning a Vaedd&#257; and a Bride</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the midst of a forest a Vaedd&#257; stayed. When
the Vaedd&#257;&rsquo;s wife went to bring water, taking the large
water-pot, the Vaedd&#257;, taking his bow and having gone in front of
the woman, as she is coming shoots [his arrows] to go by the
woman&rsquo;s ear. Every day he shoots in that manner.</p>
<p>One day when the woman went to bring water she met with the
woman&rsquo;s elder brother; he asked, &ldquo;What is it, younger
sister, that you are so thin for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman said, &ldquo;An&#275;, elder brother, when I have
taken water and am going home, the Vaedd&#257; shoots [his arrows] to
go by my ear. Through that trouble I am becoming thin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Vaedd&#257; [her brother] says, &ldquo;Younger
sister, for that I will tell you a clever trick. To-day also when he
has shot as you are going, say, &lsquo;There will be better shooters
than that.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That day when he was shooting the woman said this word. Then the
Vaedd&#257; asked, &ldquo;What, A&#7693;iy&#275;! didst thou
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the woman says, &ldquo;There will be better shooters than
that in this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Vaedd&#257; says, &ldquo;Where, A&#7693;in! are they? I
must seek them and look at them. Tie up a bundle of cooked rice and
bring it.&rdquo; So having cooked a bundle of cooked rice she gave
it.</p>
<p>Taking it, the Vaedd&#257; began to go through the forest jungle
(<i lang="si-latn">him&#257;lay&#275;</i>). At the time when he was
going he saw <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>that a man is staying looking upwards. The
Vaedd&#257; having gone near asked, &ldquo;What are you staying looking
upward for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now eight days since I shot at a bird. I am waiting
until it falls.&rdquo; When a little time had gone, the bird&rsquo;s
flesh, having become decomposed, fell down.</p>
<p>At that time the Vaedd&#257; thought, &ldquo;A better shooter than I
is this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to inquire further, the two persons, having joined
together, began to go through the midst of the forest. At the time when
they were going they saw yet a man who is looking upward. These two
having gone near asked, &ldquo;What are you staying looking upward
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;I see the celestial nymphs<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e5698src" href="#xd27e5698" name="xd27e5698src">1</a> dancing
in the divine world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two persons spoke together: &ldquo;In sight this person is more
dexterous than we.&rdquo; Thereupon these three having joined together,
at the time when they were going [they saw that] at the bottom of a Jak
tree a bride was staying, leaning against the tree. A cobra was
preparing to strike the woman.</p>
<p>Then the shooter said, &ldquo;I do not see far. You aim the arrow
and show me [the direction]; then I will shoot.&rdquo; Then he shot at
the cobra. The arrow having entered the cobra in the quarter of the
cobra&rsquo;s tail, came out near the bride&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>The three Vaedd&#257;s went to the place where the bride is. That
they had shot the cobra no one in the bride&rsquo;s party knows.
Thereupon, when they tried to call the bride and go away, the
Vaedd&#257;s did not allow them to call her and go. [They said],
&ldquo;If this cobra having bitten her she had died, where would there
be a bride for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the parties instituted law-suits. Both the parties having gone
near the King told him to decide the law-suit. The King having heard
the law-suit, after he had looked [into the matter] was also unable to
decide it. At that time he asked the Vaedd&#257;s, &ldquo;To whom must
this woman belong?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href=
"#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thereupon the Vaedd&#257;s said, &ldquo;To both parties she cannot
belong. She must belong to our teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Should you say, &ldquo;Did they say who that was?&rdquo; it was
indeed that woman who at first took the water.</p>

<p class="first">In <i>Folk-Tales of Hindustan</i> (Shaik Chilli), p.
83, a Prince while travelling met with an archer who had shot an arrow
at a star fourteen years before and was awaiting its fall. He saw its
approach when it was still a thousand miles away, and warned the Prince
to avoid it.</p>
<p>In <i>Old Deccan Days</i> (M. Frere), p. 297, the chief amusement of
a rich man was shooting his arrow every morning through one of the
pearls of his wife&rsquo;s nose-ring. When her brother came to take her
to visit her parents, he found her thin and miserable, as she feared
the arrow might some day strike her face. Each day the husband asked
her, &ldquo;Was there ever a man as clever as I am?&rdquo; and she
replied that there never was one. Her brother advised her to say next
time that there were many men in the world cleverer than he was. When
she said this her husband left her in order to find one of them. He met
a clever wrestler and a clever pandit, who joined him, and who
frightened some demons that were going to eat them. <span class=

"#xd27e5746" name="xd27e5746src">2</a> was given at the royal palace.
On the next day the surplus rice was deposited for animals to eat, and
dogs, cats, pigs, fowls, and crows came and began to devour it.</p>
<p>Then a Vaedi youth who had gone to kill some game and was hungry,
came and saw the fowls and pigs eating some cold cooked rice, whereupon
he went to the heap of rice, and pushing aside the upper part of it
took a little from the bottom and ate it.</p>
<p>At that time the royal Princess was at the open upper story of the
palace. She saw this action of the Vaedd&#257;, and said to her mother,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Amm&#275;! However poor a man may be he does not do
that disgusting work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen admonished the Princess, and said to her,
&ldquo;App&#257;! My daughter, do not say so of any man whatever; you
do not know what may happen to you&rdquo; (meaning that it might be her
fate to be married to such a man).</p>
<p>Then the Princess, speaking in ridicule of the Vaedd&#257;&rsquo;s
want of good looks, replied, &ldquo;If so, why should I wear this
costume? [I may as well begin to dress like my future husband&rsquo;s
people].&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vaedd&#257;, after stopping and hearing this conversation, went
away.</p>
<p>As a lion used to come to that city [and carry off the inhabitants]
the King subsequently caused the following proclamation to be made by
beat of tom-toms: &ldquo;I will give my daughter to any person whatever
who kills the lion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161"
name="pb161">161</a>]</span>which comes to this city.&rdquo; On hearing
this, the Vaedi youth having dug a hole in the path by which the lion
came, and having got hid in it, when the animal approached shot it with
his bow and arrow and killed it.</p>
<p>When the King learnt that somebody had killed the lion he gave
public notice that its destroyer should be sought for. The Vaedi youth
then came forward, and after he had [proved that he was the person who
killed it] the King gave that royal Princess to him in marriage [and he
went away with her].</p>
<p>While she was living with him another good-looking Vaedi youth
accompanied him one day. On seeing him the Princess trickishly drove
away the Vaedd&#257; who was her husband, and married that handsome
Vaedi youth.</p>
<p>It was not long before this Vaedd&#257; one night killed a buffalo,
and [taking some of the flesh] said to the Princess, &ldquo;Cook this,
and give it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess replied, &ldquo;It would be disgusting work for me to
do; it is no business of mine. [She added] &ldquo;What does it matter
if my first husband is not good-looking? He was good to me.&rdquo;
Saying this, she drove this Vaedd&#257; away, and seeking the place
where the first Vaedd&#257; whom she had married was stopping, went to
him and said, &ldquo;Let us go [off together].&rdquo; But the
Vaedd&#257; said, &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, she put on her Princess&rsquo;s robes as before, and
came away.</p>
<p>In a little while afterwards that very Vaedd&#257; was appointed to
the kingship, and everybody subsequently lived prosperously and in
health.</p>

rice-field, with his hand he loosened and uprooted and threw them all
down. Having made the rice-field, and made the ridges in it, he came
home and said, &ldquo;I have made a little rice-field plot (<i lang=
"si-latn">liyadda</i>); to sow it give me a little paddy,&rdquo; he
asked his brothers. When he said it they did not give it.</p>
<p>Thereafter, having gone near his uncle<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5800src" href="#xd27e5800" name="xd27e5800src">2</a> he spoke
thus, &ldquo;I have made a rice-field plot; let us go to look at this
rice-field plot. How about a little paddy for it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Thereupon his uncle said, &ldquo;Having looked at the rice-field I
will give you paddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two together went to the rice-field. While there his uncle
ascertained the size of the rice-field and the quantity of paddy that
was necessary for it, and having come home told him to take a round
corn store (<i lang="si-latn">bissak</i>) in which sixty <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e5812" title="Source: amunas">amu&#7751;as</span> (about
350 bushels) of paddy were tied up. Thereupon the giant who was on the
ash-heap, placing the corn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href=
"#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>store of sixty <span class="corr"
id="xd27e5817" title="Source: amunas">amu&#7751;as</span> on his
shoulder, brought it home; and having made [the paddy] sprout, sowed
the rice-field.</p>
<p>After the [paddy in the] rice-field ripened he cut it and trampled
it [by means of buffaloes], and having collected and placed the paddy
in a heap, came home. Having returned summoning his brothers, he told
them to climb upon the heap of paddy, and look if the spires [of the
d&#257;gabas] at Anur&#257;dhapura are visible. Having looked in that
way, and having seen them, though they were visible they said they were
not. Thereupon anger having come to the giant of the ash-heap, he
kicked the paddy heap, and having come home, taking his sword began to
go away somewhere.</p>
<p>While going thus, he saw that yet [another] giant, having uprooted a
Banyan-tree, is polishing his teeth [with it], and he went quite near.
Thereupon, the giant asked the giant of the ash-heap, &ldquo;Where are
you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to seek a means of subsistence,&rdquo; he gave
answer.</p>
<p>The two persons having conversed in this manner, while the two were
going away together they saw that yet a giant, having threaded an
elephant on a fish-hook, had cast it in a river,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5828src" href="#xd27e5828" name="xd27e5828src">3</a> and they
asked him, &ldquo;What are you doing? Why have you thrown an elephant
into the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant says, &ldquo;I am trying to catch and take a sand fish.
Where are you two going?&rdquo; he asked these two persons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going in order to seek a means of subsistence,&rdquo;
these two said.</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;If so, I will come with you,&rdquo; and having
abandoned his work, and cast away the elephant, he also set off with
them, and the three persons began to go away.</p>
<p>While they were going thus they met with a river. They saw that in
the river yet [another] giant having placed his foot across the river,
from this bank to the far bank, is causing the water to stop. The giant
asked, &ldquo;Where are you three persons going?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span></p>
<p>The three persons said, &ldquo;We are going to seek a means of
subsistence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good. I also will come with you,&rdquo; the giant
said.</p>
<p>Well then, while these three are going, having met with yet a river,
when the giant who was on the ash-heap told the other giants to hang on
his body, the other giants hung on it. After that, having descended
into the river, the giant began to swim in the river. At that time a
fish came to swallow them. Having chopped the fish with his sword, the
giant who stayed on the ash-heap, taking the fish and taking these
giants, swam to the far bank.</p>
<p>Thereafter, a giant having gone up a tree, they told him to look for
a place where there is fire. He said that a fire smoke is rising. Then
they told him to mark [the direction] and bring fire.</p>
<p>The giant having gone, when he looked about saw that a woman,
[after] placing a large pot of paddy on the hearth, was pouring water
over (that is, bathing) a child. At the time when he asked for a little
fire, she said, &ldquo;I am pouring water over the child. You come and
take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant having gone, at the time when he was bending to take the
fire the woman arose and came, and having lifted up and cast the giant
on the heap of fire-charcoal, and killed him, put him in the house.</p>
<p>Thereafter, to look for him yet [another] giant went. When that
giant also in that way was bending down, the woman having arisen and
come, and put him on the fire-heap, and killed him, put him into the
house.</p>
<p>When [the ash-heap giant] told that [other] giant to look for the
two giants, he went, and asked, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t our men come
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the woman said, &ldquo;Those men I saw not.&rdquo; After
that, like the giants who first got the fire, at the time when he was
bending down to take the fire, the woman having arisen and killed him
also in the way in which she killed the first giants, put him into the
house.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the giant who at first did cultivation work having gone,
taking his sword also, asked, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t my three men come
here?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p>At that time the woman said, &ldquo;I did not see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, at the time when the giant prepared to cut the woman with
his sword, she said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Don&rsquo;t cut me. I will give
your men.&rdquo; Having said it, and restored the three men to
consciousness, she gave them.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5875src" href=
"#xd27e5875" name="xd27e5875src">4</a></p>
<p>Taking the giants also who had brought the fire, and having come
again near the last river, and roasted the fish, the four persons
divided it, and ate. He put the [back] bone of the fish into the river.
The four persons again began to go away.</p>
<p>After that, having gone to the city, when they asked for a
rest-house [the people] said, &ldquo;The rest-house indeed we can give.
A bone having become fixed across in this river, water has become
scarce [on account of it].&rdquo; They told them to remove the bone:
&ldquo;We will give a Princess of our King&rsquo;s for removing it.
That also (<i lang="si-latn">&#275;t</i>) anyone is unable to
do.&rdquo; This speech the men of that country said to these
giants.</p>
<p>After that, these giants having said, &ldquo;It is becoming night
for us; we cannot go,&rdquo; stayed in the resting-place at that very
spot. [Afterwards], that giant of the ash-heap having gone and thrown
aside the bone, brought a pot of water.</p>
<p>Yet [another] man, breaking the bone, took a piece near the King.
And the King was ready to give the Princess to the man. Then the giant
who was on the ash-heap having gone near the King (<i lang=
"si-latn">raju</i>), taking the bone, said, &ldquo;It was not that man;
it was I who took and cast away the bone.&rdquo; Thereafter the King
beheaded the man who said it falsely.</p>
<p>He was ready to give the [Princess] to the giant who was on the
ash-heap. But the giant gave the Princess to the giant who uprooted the
Banyan-tree; and having planted a Lime-tree and put a Blue-lotus flower
into a small copper pot full of water, and said, &ldquo;Should any harm
occur to me the Lime-tree will blanch,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5894src" href="#xd27e5894" name="xd27e5894src">5</a> or will
become like dying; the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>Blue-lotus flower will fade. At
that time thou must come seeking me,&rdquo; the giant of the ash-heap
began to go away [with the other two giants].</p>
<p>Having gone to yet [another] city he asked for a resting-place.
Thereupon they said, &ldquo;An&#275;! We can give a resting-place
indeed. A lion having come eats the city people. There is not a means
of getting firewood [for cooking]. Also it is said that the King will
give our King&rsquo;s Princess to a person who has killed the
lion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the giant of the ash-heap, getting a resting-place
there, took an axe, and having gone into the jungle, at the time when
he was walking about the lion was sleeping in the jungle. This giant
having chopped with the axe at the head of the lion and killed it, came
back [after] cutting off his ear.</p>
<p>Yet [another] man having come [after] cutting off the lion&rsquo;s
head, gave it to the King. Well then, the King became ready to give the
Princess to the man. At that time this giant having gone near the King,
said, &ldquo;It is not that one who cut off the head; it is I [who
killed it],&rdquo; and he gave him the lion&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the King having beheaded the man who told him falsely,
was ready to give [the Princess] to the giant of the ash-heap. The
giant of the ash-heap gave the Princess to the giant who was stringing
the elephant on the fish-hook; and in the very manner as at first
having planted a Lime-tree and put a Blue-lotus flower in a small
copper pot of water and given him it, he said, &ldquo;Should any harm
occur to me the Lime-tree will die, the Blue-lotus flower will fade. At
that time you must come seeking me;&rdquo; and those two giants began
to go away.</p>
<p>Having gone to a city they asked for a resting-place. Thereupon the
men said, &ldquo;In our country we cannot give resting-places. A
leopard having come eats the men. There is a Princess of our
King&rsquo;s. To a person who has killed the leopard he will give the
Princess, he said. That also anyone is unable to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, these two giants got the resting-place there. The
giant of the ash-heap taking also the axe, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>went
into the jungle, and when he looked the leopard was sleeping. The giant
having chopped at the leopard with the axe and killed it, came back
[after] cutting off the ear.</p>
<p>Another man having seen it, came [after] cutting off the head of the
leopard, and gave it to the King. When the King was becoming ready to
give the Princess to the man, the giant of the ash-heap went near the
King, and said, &ldquo;It is not that man who killed the leopard; it is
I,&rdquo; and he gave him the leopard&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the King having beheaded the man who said it falsely,
made ready to give the Princess to the giant of the ash-heap. The giant
having given the Princess to the giant who stopped the water with his
foot, and in the first manner having planted a Lime-tree and put a
Blue-lotus flower into a small copper pot of water, and said, &ldquo;If
there be any harm to me the Lime-tree will die, the Blue-lotus flower
will fade. At that time come seeking me,&rdquo; the giant of the
ash-heap began to go away alone.</p>
<p>Having gone to a city that had become abandoned, at the time when he
is looking at the houses in a street, a Princess having been in an
upper story says, &ldquo;Our father having become insane, and having
eaten all the city people, now this city is desolate. Why have you
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon this giant said, &ldquo;I came because of [the want of] a
means of subsistence.&rdquo; Having halted there, and that day having
eaten cooked rice from there, he asked at the hand of the Princess,
&ldquo;Are there men&#275;ri [seeds]<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5927src" href="#xd27e5927" name="xd27e5927src">6</a> and dried
areka-nuts?&rdquo; Thereupon the Princess having said<span class="corr"
id="xd27e5933" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;There are,&rdquo;
sought and gave them.</p>
<p>The giant of the ash-heap put down the men&#275;ri from inside the
open ground in front of the house up to the house. The dried areka-nuts
he put above it. Having put them down, taking the sword also and half
shutting the door he remained [there]. At that time the King having
come, sprang towards the doorway [and slipped upon the loose seeds and
nuts]. Thereupon he of the ash-heap chopped at him with the sword, and
killed the King.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5938src" href="#xd27e5938"
name="xd27e5938src">7</a> Having killed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>him, taking the
Princess he began to go away. Having thus gone, and having built a
house near a river, they remained there.</p>
<p>One day, when the Princess was bathing at the river, she uprooted a
hair<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5945src" href="#xd27e5945" name=
"xd27e5945src">8</a> of the Princess&rsquo;s, and it fell into the
water. The hair having gone along the river, and having caught on a
fish (<i lang="si-latn">m&#257;lu k&#363;riyeku&#7789;a</i>), the fish
swallowed it. The fish fell into the net of the fisherman of the King
of that country. Having cut open the fish, at the time when he looked
[inside it] a hair had been made into a ball. When he unrolled the hair
and looked at it, its length was seven fathoms seven hands.</p>
<p>The fisherman gave it to the King. Thereupon the King said,
&ldquo;To a person who should find and give me the woman who owns this
hair, I will give a fourth share from my city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A widow woman said, &ldquo;I can, if you will give me a ship.&rdquo;
Thereupon the King gave her a ship.</p>
<p>The widow woman having taken the ship, found the Princess. Having
been there a few days, she asked at the hand of the Princess,
&ldquo;Has your husband confidence in you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;Yes, he has confidence in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the old woman said, &ldquo;It is good. If he has
confidence in you ask where his life is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess asked at the hand of the Prince (giant), &ldquo;Where
is your life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time the Prince (giant) said, &ldquo;My life is in the
sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, the giant of the ash-heap, having placed the sword in the
house, went on a journey. This Princess had previously (<i lang=
"si-latn">kalin</i>, betimes) told at the hand of the widow woman that
the giant&rsquo;s life is in the sword. That day the Princess said to
the widow woman, &ldquo;Look at my head&rdquo; (to search for insects).
After that, when the widow woman was looking and looking the Princess
went to sleep.</p>
<p>The widow woman having taken the sword that was on the ground [in
the house], and put it into the fire on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>hearth,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5980src"
href="#xd27e5980" name="xd27e5980src">9</a> lifted up the Princess, and
having put her in the ship, and crossed over to that bank, handed over
the Princess to the King. The King gave the widow woman many presents
and distinctions.</p>
<p>The giant of the ash-heap having become unconscious, fell down. In
the very way he told the three giants whom he caused to stay at first,
the Lime-trees died, the Blue-lotus flowers faded.</p>
<p>The three giants came seeking him. When they came he was dead. The
three persons having dug the ash-heap, when they looked the sword was
even yet there. Taking it, at the time when they were polishing it the
giant of the ash-heap became conscious. His three friendly giants
asked, &ldquo;What is this that happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the giant of the ash-heap said, &ldquo;A widow woman
stayed near us. It is that woman, indeed, who did this work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the giants asked, &ldquo;Whence came the woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came from the sea,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Well then, these very four giants having gone on the sea, and having
gone to the city at which is the Princess, at the time when they looked
saw that the Princess is bound [in marriage] to the King.</p>
<p>Having cut down the King and the widow woman, the giant of the
ash-heap exercised the sovereignty of that country; and the other
giants went back to the very places where each of them stayed.<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In <i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. xvii, p. 50, in a
Salsette story by Mr. G. Fr. D&rsquo;Penha, a Prince to avoid marrying
his sister went away with a hunter and a carpenter. At a deserted city
at which they stayed a R&#257;kshasa came daily when one was left to
cook, and ate the rice. On the third day the Prince was the cook, and
he killed the R&#257;kshasa. The Prince&rsquo;s life was in his sword;
if it rusted he fell sick, if it broke he would die. He made the
carpenter King of the city and the hunter King of another, giving them
life-index <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>plants. The Prince then went away, killed
another R&#257;kshasa, and got from his waist a diamond which showed a
passage through the water of a tank to a palace where he married a
Princess and became King. He then forgot his sword, and it rusted. His
friends learnt by the fading plants that he was ill, and found him just
alive. He recovered when they cleaned and repolished the sword, after
which they became his Chief Officers of State.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Hindustan</i> (Shaik Chilli), p. 45, a Prince,
accompanied by the sons of a goldsmith, a pa&#7751;&#7693;it, and a
carpenter, went to kill a giant. While they halted, a giant took the
food that each in turn cooked. When the Prince cooked he vanquished the
giant, who offered him his daughter in marriage, and joined his party.
The Prince married her to the goldsmith&rsquo;s son, and went to
another city where the Prince&rsquo;s giant killed a giant who ate the
people. The King&rsquo;s daughter was married to the <span class="corr"
id="xd27e6019" title=
"Source: pandit&rsquo;s">pa&#7751;&#7693;it&rsquo;s</span> son. At a
third city the giant killed a lion, and a Princess was married to the
carpenter&rsquo;s son. When they arrived at the city of the giant they
had come to kill, the Prince and giant found he was the one already
killed at the second city. These giants could take any shape, and thus
evidently were R&#257;kshasas. The Prince married a Princess at the
fourth city and lived there with his giant. One day his wife lost her
shoe while bathing in a stream, and a R&#257;ja&rsquo;s son found it
floating down. A witch undertook to find the owner, dived into the
water, came to the fort, became the Princess&rsquo;s servant, and
learnt that the Prince&rsquo;s life lay in the brightness of his sword;
if it became rusty he would die. One night the witch burnt the sword in
a furnace, the Prince died, and she took his wife through the water to
her admirer&rsquo;s palace, where she demanded a year&rsquo;s delay
before marrying him. The Prince&rsquo;s giant found and repolished the
sword, and the Prince revived. They summoned the other friends, went in
search of the Princess, killed the R&#257;ja, his son, and the witch,
and returned home.</p>
<p>In <i>Tales of the Punjab</i> (Mrs. Steele), p. 42, when a Prince
was travelling accompanied by a knife-grinder, a blacksmith, and a
carpenter, a demon in the form of a mannikin ate the food which the
last three cooked in turn, but was killed by the Prince when he cooked.
The Prince married the knife-grinder to the King&rsquo;s daughter, the
blacksmith to the daughter of a King at another city at which the
Prince killed a ghost (<i lang="si-latn">Chu&#7771;el</i>), and the
carpenter to a Princess at a third city. To each of the friends the
Prince gave a barley plant as his life index; if it drooped he would be
in trouble and needing their help. He went on, killed a Jinn who had
carried off a Princess with golden hair, married her, and lived at the
Jinn&rsquo;s palace. When bathing she set one or two hairs afloat in a
B&#333;-leaf cup, which was secured by a King lower down the river. A
wise woman sent to find their owner, discovered her, ascertained
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>that the Prince&rsquo;s life was in his sword,
at night put it in a fire, and when the hilt rolled off the Prince
died. She then carried off the Princess to the King. As the barley
plants snapped in two, the three friends came with armies, found the
body of the Prince and his sword, repaired and repolished the latter,
and thus restored the Prince&rsquo;s life. The carpenter discovered the
Princess, made a flying palankin, into which she, together with the
King&rsquo;s sister and the wise woman, mounted with him, and he sailed
back to the Prince, throwing down the other two women on the way.</p>
<p>In <i><span class="corr" id="xd27e6035" title=
"Source: S&#257;gas">Sagas</span> from the Far East</i>, p. 39, four
companions took possession of a house on a hill. They cooked in turn,
the other three going to hunt. On each day a demoness in the form of a
woman a span high begged a taste of the food, and she and the food and
cooking-pot then disappeared. The fourth man killed her.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. i, p. 386, the sword incident varies. A Prince&rsquo;s wife,
wishing to deprive him of the magic power conferred by the sword, put
the weapon in a fire while he slept. He became unconscious when the
sword was dimmed, but recovered when the Goddess Durg&#257; restored
its brightness.</p>
<p>In the same work, vol. ii, p. 487, an Asura&rsquo;s vital point was
his left hand; he died when a King shot him through it.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata</i> (<i lang=
"sa-latn">Va&#7751;a Parva</i>, cccxi) four of the
P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava Princes were killed in turn by a Yaksha as
soon as they drank at a pool. When the eldest brother answered his
questions satisfactorily he revived them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">The Story about a Giant</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country two men spoke together:
&ldquo;Let us two persons go to seek the kingdom gored [by] the Sky
Buffalo,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6063src" href="#xd27e6063"
name="xd27e6063src">1</a> they said, it is said.</p>
<p>After that the two went, it is said. Procuring provisions, they
began to go. At the time when they are going thus for not much time,
one man was struck by inability [to proceed]. The man said, it is said,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go here alone,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without going alone what shall I do?&rdquo; he said. After
that, that man died.</p>
<p>This man having gone, contracted (<i>lit.</i>, tied) a marriage.
Putting [out of consideration] the displeasure of the woman&rsquo;s two
parents, he contracted the marriage. The mother-in-law and
father-in-law, both of them, having said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you two
remain in my house,&rdquo; told them to go. After that, the son-in-law
having caused thieves to be brought, took the goods in the house that
he had not brought; the best (<i lang="si-latn">hon&#774;da
hon&#774;da</i>) goods the man took, a few things those men got.</p>
<p>The man, taking the woman, went to another city. At the time when
they were at the city no long time, a child was born to the woman. The
child, at the time when he was seven years of age, catching the
remaining Hares and Mouse-deer dashes them to the ground. A long time
after twelve years were fulfilled, having run after Sambhar deer and
caught them he dashes them to the ground;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6081src" href="#xd27e6081" name="xd27e6081src">2</a> having
caught Boars also he dashes them to the ground. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span></p>
<p>That he is doing thus was known to everybody. Having perceived it
they told the matter to the King of that city. The King, causing the
young man to be brought, and having given him many offices, made him
remain near the King; he is stopping there.</p>
<p>Then a hostile army having come to the city and laid [siege] to the
city,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6090src" href="#xd27e6090" name=
"xd27e6090src">3</a> after the Ministers told the King, causing the
giant to be brought he asked, &ldquo;A hostile army having come is
surrounding my city. On account of it, art thou able to drive off and
send away the army?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant said, &ldquo;I am not unable to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King said, &ldquo;What are the things thou wantest
for it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>When he asked, he said, &ldquo;Should I receive a tusk elephant and
the sword, it will do.&rdquo; Afterwards he gave the tusk elephant and
sword.</p>
<p>Having waited until the time when he gives them, he went for the
battle. Having gone, and having cut down that army, he came to the
royal palace. Having come, he made obeisance<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6103src" href="#xd27e6103" name="xd27e6103src">4</a> to the King
[and related an account of his victory]. After that, the King having
given half the kingdom to the giant, he remained [there].</p>
<p>Well then, beginning from that day, he remained exercising the
sovereignty [over the half of the kingdom] until the time when he
dies.</p>

<p class="first">I was informed that in the allusion to the Sky Buffalo
which gored the earth, reference is made to the country in which the
sky pierces (that is, touches) the earth (see vol. i, p. 284). The Sky
Buffalo is not mentioned elsewhere in these stories.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. i, p. 6, the God &#346;iva is represented as saying,
&ldquo;Moreover, this world resembling a skull, rests in my hand; for
the two skull-shaped halves of the [Mundane] egg before mentioned are
called heaven and earth.&rdquo; It is evident that here also the two
halves of the egg, that is, the sky and the earth, are supposed to be
in contact, the sky resting on the earth. In the Rigveda they are
termed two bowls; the sun travelled in the <span class=

upper one was supported by pillars.</p>
<p>The feats of the youthful giant in chasing and seizing wild animals
are borrowed from the Mah&#257;vansa, chapter xxiii (p. 161 of
Professor Geiger&rsquo;s translation), where it is stated of
Kha&ntilde;jad&#275;va, one of the ten leading chiefs under King
Du&#7789;&#7789;ha-G&#257;ma&#7751;i in the second century <span class=

folk he chased at these times great buffaloes, as many as rose up, and
grasped them by the leg with his hand, and when he had whirled them
round his head the young man dashed them to the ground, breaking their
bones.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Wanni country, in the north-western quarter of
the Island of Lan&#805;k&#257; (Ceylon), there is a village called
Andara-waewa. In that village a giant was born. His parents, cherishing
him, reared the child.</p>
<p>While the child is at the age for playing seated, he eats about two
quarts of cooked rice [daily]. At the walking age he eats about three
quarts of cooked rice. While seven years of age he eats about four
quarts of cooked rice.</p>
<p>Having gone with children who walked about for amusement, having
caught hares and mouse-deer, and struck them on the ground, killing
them, he brings them [home]. After he has brought them, his two parents
ask, &ldquo;Whence, son, are these?&rdquo; Then the child says,
&ldquo;Mother, having gone running I seized them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, having been living in that manner, at the age of about twelve
years he said to his mother, &ldquo;Mother, give me food [to enable me]
to go to cut a chena.&rdquo; So his mother gave him food.</p>
<p>The child having eaten the food, and gone to the jungle taking two
bill-hooks, cut the chena that very day. Having cut it, and come home,
he said to his mother, &ldquo;Mother, I cut a chena. I don&rsquo;t know
the time for setting fire to it. Because of it, tell father to set fire
to the chena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, his mother said, &ldquo;Our son cut a chena. Set fire to
it; son does not know the time for setting fire [to it].&rdquo; After
that, the man went and set fire to the chena.</p>
<p>This giant-child having gone, cut the fence [sticks] for the chena
in one day; on the next day he went, and sowed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>it
till he finished it. The sowing account was a p&#257;ela (a quarter of
an amu&#7751;a of 5.7 bushels) of millet.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6150src" href="#xd27e6150" name="xd27e6150src">1</a></p>
<p>On the next day he said to his mother, &ldquo;Mother, I cut a chena
indeed; for the purpose of going and doing the work at a <i lang=
"si-latn">t&#257;walla</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e6168src" href=
"#xd27e6168" name="xd27e6168src">2</a> also, give me food.&rdquo;
Afterwards his mother gave him food. Having eaten the food, the child
went to the t&#257;walla, and put up earthen ridges over the ground for
[making a field large enough for sowing in it] one and a half
amu&#7751;as (8.55 bushels) of paddy.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6171src" href="#xd27e6171" name="xd27e6171src">3</a> Having put
them up he came home.</p>
<p>Having gone on the following day, he made [the soil into]
mud<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6176src" href="#xd27e6176" name=
"xd27e6176src">4</a> [by causing cattle to trample it]. Having made [it
into] mud he came home.</p>
<p>Having come, he said to his mother, &ldquo;Mother, place one and a
half amu&#7751;as of paddy in water [to cause it to sprout] for sowing
in the t&#257;walla.&rdquo; Afterwards his mother made the paddy
sprout. This child took the one and a half amu&#7751;as of paddy, and
sowed it that very day. In the evening he came home.</p>
<p>On the following day he said to his mother, &ldquo;Mother, give me
food. I indeed sowed the t&#257;walla; there is still to build the
watch-hut in it.&rdquo; Afterwards his mother gave him food. The child
ate the food, and went to the t&#257;walla. Having gone there, and that
very day having made the fence, and that very day having built the
watch-hut, he came home. Having eaten food, he went back to the
watch-hut, and with his own foot he sprinkles water over the
<span class="corr" id="xd27e6185" title=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=

<p>At that time the King caused a Mallawa<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6194src" href="#xd27e6194" name="xd27e6194src">6</a> giant to be
brought to Kandy. Many men wrestled with the Mallawa giant and fell.
After that, the King said to the Ministers, &ldquo;Go and find a
thoroughly strong giant, and come back.&rdquo; Afterwards the Ministers
spread the news: &ldquo;Is there a giant able to wrestle with the
Mallawa giant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then certain men said, &ldquo;At the village called Andara-waewa
there is a man called Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi, who eats the cooked rice
from seven [quarts] of rice. That man is good for wrestling with the
Mallawa giant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they said it, the Ministers went to Andara-waewa to seek the
giant Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi. When they went there, the boy
Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi was not at home; only the giant&rsquo;s mother was
there. They asked at the hand of his mother, &ldquo;Where is now
Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi?&rdquo; Then his mother said, &ldquo;My son went to
the watch-hut at the t&#257;walla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Ministers went to the t&#257;walla to seek him. As
they were going there they saw Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi sprinkling water for
the t&#257;walla with his foot. Thereupon the Ministers went to the
place where Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi was sprinkling water. Having gone, the
Ministers asked, &ldquo;Is it you they call Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi of
Andara-waewa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi said, &ldquo;Yes, it is I myself. What
matter have you come about?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Then the Ministers said, &ldquo;It has been arranged by the King
[that you are] to go for the Mallawa wrestling. Because of it, get
ready<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6209src" href="#xd27e6209" name=
"xd27e6209src">7</a> for you to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi having come home with the Ministers,
asked at the hand of his mother, &ldquo;Mother, haven&rsquo;t you
cooked yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother said, &ldquo;Son, I have not yet cooked. I have only
boiled five quarts of men&#275;ri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi having [drunk] the milk taken from seven
buffalo cows in the large cooking-pot, and having eaten those five
quarts of boiled men&#275;ri, [after] washing his [right] hand
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>and taking his betel bag also, said to the
Ministers, &ldquo;Let us go;&rdquo; and Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi and the
Ministers went.</p>
<p>At the time when they are going, there are a great many pumpkins at
a chena on the path. Having seen them, Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi, plucking
four pumpkins also and continuing to eat them, went to Kandy.</p>
<p>The Ministers who went with him said to the King,
&ldquo;Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi of Andara-waewa has come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King told Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi to come near, and said, &ldquo;Can
you wrestle with the Mallawa one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi replied, &ldquo;Putting one Mallawa person
[out of consideration], should seven come I am not afraid.&rdquo; After
that, the King told him to go for the wrestling with the Mallawa
one.</p>
<p>As soon as Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi went, he seized the Mallawa one. Then
the bones of the Mallawa one were broken. The King said<span class=
"corr" id="xd27e6232" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;&#256;!
Kill not my Mallawa one!&rdquo; So Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi let go. The
Mallawa one having died, fell on the ground.</p>
<p>After that, the King was displeased with Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi. Having
become displeased he said to the Ministers, &ldquo;You must put
Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi on the other bank of the river
(Mahawaeli-gan&#774;ga).&rdquo; The Ministers put Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi
on the other bank.</p>
<p>As Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi was coming away to his village, sixty persons
having come together for a paddy <i lang="si-latn">kayiya</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6242src" href="#xd27e6242" name="xd27e6242src">8</a>
were at the foot of a tree. Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi having gone there,
asked, &ldquo;What are you come together there for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the men said, &ldquo;We have come together to cut a paddy
kayiya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi said, &ldquo;Are you willing for me also to cut
the paddy plants for a breath (<i lang=
"si-latn">husmak</i>)?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men said, &ldquo;It is very good; let us cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, asking for the sickles from each one of the men, and
having broken them, and thrown them down, and drawn out the
betel-cutter that was in Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi&rsquo;s betel wallet
(<i lang="si-latn">bulat-payiya</i>), taking it he began to cut the
paddy plants. Only the paddy plants of two <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e6259" title="Source: amunas">amu&#7751;as</span> of paddy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>(about four and a half acres) were ripe; there
were no more.</p>
<p>He finished the two <span class="corr" id="xd27e6267" title=
"Source: amunas">amu&#7751;as</span> of paddy plants, and because there
were no [more] ripe paddy plants, cutting the fence of the upper field
and having gone [there], he began to cut the green paddy plants.</p>
<p>Then the men who owned the field said and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
cut [those].&rdquo; He does not stop. Afterwards the men tied a
ball.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6272src" href="#xd27e6272" name=
"xd27e6272src">9</a></p>
<p>Afterwards, the giant having come to the high ground [outside the
field], when he came to the place where the men were near the tree, the
men said, &ldquo;Let us go to eat the kayiya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi said, &ldquo;You go and eat the kayiya; I
am going to my village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was coming on and on, having met with a wild buffalo it began
to gore him. So Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi seized the two horns of the
buffalo, and loosening the two horns, went to his village [with
them].</p>
<p>Having gone [there], and given into his mother&rsquo;s hand the two
horns, he said, &ldquo;Mother, having conquered in the Mallawa
wrestling, at the time when I was coming back about sixty men had come
together to cut the paddy plants in a rice field. At the hand of the
men I asked, &lsquo;What are you many men joined together there
for?&rsquo; Then the men said, &lsquo;We are [here] to cut a paddy
kayiya.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards, asking for the men&rsquo;s sickles, I broke them
and threw them down, and taking the betel-cutter<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6287src" href="#xd27e6287" name="xd27e6287src">10</a> that was in
my betel wallet, descended to the field, and having cut the paddy
plants, there also I got the victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was coming away, a wild buffalo came to gore me.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>Afterwards, loosening the buffalo&rsquo;s two
horns [I brought them away]. These indeed are the two horns.&rdquo; He
told her all the matters.</p>
<p>Then his mother said, &ldquo;Son, except that you have said that
word to me, do not say it for anyone else to hear;&rdquo; and having
cooked several kinds of cakes, and milk-rice, gave them to
Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi the Giant to eat.</p>

<p class="first">This story differs from nearly all the others in being
almost certainly based on a considerable statum of fact. Apparently, it
is the exaggerated tradition about a very strong man who defeated a
celebrated Indian wrestler at Kandy. The story also gives more details
concerning the village cultivations than any others I have met
with.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is not the only record of this Hi&#7789;ih&#257;mi. Among
the names of the deified chiefs of ancient times, termed
Ba&#7751;&#7693;&#257;ra, there is one called Hi&#7789;i
Ba&#7751;&#7693;&#257;ra, who is said to have lived at a village called
G&#333;karaella, twelve miles north-east of Kurun&#257;egala. It is
possible that he is the hero of this story; but as the names of the
villages are different there is considerable doubt regarding it. There
was a village called Andara-waewa (in the Wanni Hat-pattu district of
the North-western Province) which was abandoned some centuries ago, the
field and village tank having become overgrown with jungle and
forest.</p>
<p>As Kandy was founded early in the fourteenth century, according to
the manuscript <i lang="si-latn">Pradh&#257;na nuwarawal</i>, the story

<p class="first">A certain Gamar&#257;la had a daughter, it is said.
Many persons having come, ask to marry the daughter. After they have
asked it, this<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6325src" href="#xd27e6325"
name="xd27e6325src">2</a> Gamar&#257;la asks those people who come,
&ldquo;Do you know the New Speech?&rdquo; At that time those people
say, &ldquo;An&#275;! There is not a New Speech that we know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If so, go you away,&rdquo; the<a class="noteref" id=

Gamar&#257;la says to those parties. Well then, those people go.</p>
<p>Then still a party come. He asks that party, also, in that very
manner, &ldquo;Do you know the New Speech?&rdquo; Thereupon that party
say, &ldquo;An&#275;! There is not a New Speech that we know.&rdquo;
Then the man says, &ldquo;If so, I will not give my girl. I will give
her [only] to the man who knows the New Speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this manner, many persons having asked and asked, went away.
Because even one person is not learning the New Speech, even one person
does not obtain her.</p>
<p>A young man at yet [another] village said thus: &ldquo;An&#275;!
Father, I know<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6341src" href="#xd27e6341"
name="xd27e6341src">4</a> a New Speech. Because of it, marry and give
that Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughter to me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thereupon, he having gone asks the Gamar&#257;la, &ldquo;My son
knows a New Speech. Because of it, can you marry your daughter to my
son?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la, having become pleased, said, &ldquo;It is
very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following day after that the marriage took place.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>When not much time had gone, one day when the
father-in-law and the son-in-law were getting ready to go and plough
the rice field, they said at the hand of the girl&rsquo;s mother,
&ldquo;Bring cooked rice to the rice field,&rdquo; and went to
plough.</p>
<p>While ploughing, the father-in-law&rsquo;s goad having broken he
went to the jungle below the rice field to cut a goad. Then that
girl&rsquo;s mother, bringing the cooked rice and coming to the field,
asked the son-in-law, &ldquo;Where, son-in-law, is your father-in-law
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the son-in-law said, &ldquo;And&#333;! Mother-in-law, is there
any stopping in the field for him! There, &#332;n&#805;! A woman was
beckoning with her hands; he will have gone on that account;&rdquo; and
leaving aside the quarter to which that man went, he stretched out his
hand in another direction. &ldquo;He went there, &#332;n&#805;! You go,
too,&rdquo; he said. Afterwards the mother-in-law went there.</p>
<p>Then that father-in-law having come to the rice field [after]
cutting a goad, asked at the hand of that son-in-law,
&ldquo;Son-in-law, where is your mother-in-law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the son-in-law said, &ldquo;And&#333;! Father-in-law, is there
any staying here for her! Having brought and placed here the [mat] box
of cooked rice, there, &#332;n&#805;! A man was beckoning with his
hand. She will have gone on that account;&rdquo; and leaving the
quarter to which she went, he stretched out his hand in another
direction. &ldquo;She went there, &#332;n&#805;! You go too,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la, taking the goad, went there to seek the woman.
That woman is seeking the man; the man is seeking the woman. While
seeking him in that manner that woman came to the rice field, and
asked, &ldquo;Son-in-law, hasn&rsquo;t he come yet, your
father-in-law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the son-in-law said, &ldquo;Not he, mother-in-law; he
hasn&rsquo;t come yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she was there, the father-in-law came up and beat the woman
until the goad was broken to pieces. Afterwards the woman came
home.</p>
<p>While the two men, having eaten the cooked rice, were ploughing, the
son-in-law asked at the hand of the father-in-law, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>&ldquo;Father-in-law, she is a slut whom you
have called [in marriage], isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father-in-law asked, &ldquo;What is [the meaning of] that,
son-in-law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The son-in-law replied, &ldquo;And&#333;! You have been married such
a long time, too! Don&rsquo;t you know about it? When you are sleeping,
having come every day she licks your body. Sleep to-day, also; while
you are sleeping she will lick your body, &#332;n&#805;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, having ploughed, when it became night the son-in-law,
going in front, came home, and says at the hand of the mother-in-law,
&ldquo;And&#333;! Mother-in-law, he is a salt leaf-cutter whom you have
married, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the mother-in-law asked, &ldquo;What is [the meaning of] that,
son-in-law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The son-in-law said, &ldquo;And&#333;! You have been such a long
time married, too! Don&rsquo;t you know about it? To-day, after
father-in-law has gone to sleep lick his body. There is salt taste,
&#332;n&#805;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, in the night when the father-in-law had gone to sleep,
the mother-in-law went and licked his body. Then the father-in-law,
having awoke, said, &ldquo;Ci! Ci<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6391src"
href="#xd27e6391" name="xd27e6391src">5</a>! Slut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother-in-law said, &ldquo;Ci! Ci! Salt Leaf-cutter!&rdquo; and
the two quarrelled.</p>
<p>When not much time had gone by, the<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6403src" href="#xd27e6403" name="xd27e6403src">6</a>
Gamar&#257;la said a speech to the son-in-law in this manner. His elder
daughter had been given [in marriage] to a person at a distant village.
&ldquo;Son-in-law, as I have got news that my daughter&rsquo;s illness
is severe, I am going because of it, and having gone there am
returning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying, &ldquo;Sow one and a half <span class="corr" id="xd27e6410"
title="Source: amunas">amu&#7751;as</span> of paddy (eight and a half
bushels), and block up [the gaps in] the fence, and tie the fence of
the garden, and heat water, and place it [ready] for me to bathe when I
come,&rdquo; he went.</p>
<p>Thereupon the man, getting the whole of these into his mind, said,
&ldquo;It is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Gamar&#257;la went away, he lowered out of the corn-store
one and a half <span class="corr" id="xd27e6417" title=
"Source: amunas">amu&#7751;as</span> of paddy, and having <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>taken them placed them in the rice field; and
having come back, and gone [again] taking the yoke of cattle and the
plough, and driven two or three furrows for the whole length of the
field, and sown over the field the <span class="corr" id="xd27e6422"
title="Source: amuna">amu&#7751;a</span> and a half, and tied the
cattle at a tree [in the jungle], and cut the fence that was round the
field, and come home, and also cut the fence of the garden, and heated
a pot of water, also, until it was thoroughly boiling, while he was
placing it [ready] the Gamar&#257;la came, at the time when the ground
is being stricken dark.</p>
<p>Having come, he asked, &ldquo;Did you do all these services?&rdquo;
That son-in-law said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he said it, he asked, &ldquo;Did you warm water for me to
bathe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time he said, &ldquo;Father-in-law, I heated the water, and
the chill has been taken off. Come to bathe.&rdquo; He brought that pot
of boiling water, and called him.</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;I can bathe [myself]. You
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he says, &ldquo;When do you bathe (that is, pour water
over yourself) by your own hand? Please bathe by my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; the father-in-law tying on
the bathing cloth (<i lang="si-latn"><span class="corr" id="xd27e6439"
title="Source: ambuda">ambu&#7693;a</span>
baen&#774;&#7693;aganda</i>), told him to bathe him.</p>
<p>Thereupon the son-in-law poured on his back, from the pot, that
water which was boiling. Then the Gamar&#257;la, as it was burning his
back, cried, &ldquo;What, son-in-law, did you do here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the son-in-law says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shout in that way,
father-in-law; that indeed is a piece of the New Speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because his back had been scalded, the hot water having been thrown
on it, the relatives were dismissed from his mind. The
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s back was scalded to the extent that he was unable
to rise for two or three days.</p>
<p>After two or three days had gone by, when he looked at the fence of
the garden, the fence had been cut. Thereupon the Gamar&#257;la asked
at the hand of the son-in-law, &ldquo;Son-in-law, who cut the fence of
the garden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he says, &ldquo;Father-in-law, that indeed is a part of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>New Speech,&rdquo; he said. At that time, also,
the Gamar&#257;la was angry.</p>
<p>[After] looking at it, he went to the rice field, and when he
looked, the fence of the rice field also had been cut, and paddy had
been sown in the [unploughed] rice field. When he asked also at the
hand of the son-in-law, &ldquo;What is [the meaning of] that?&rdquo;
&ldquo;A part of the New Speech, indeed, is that,&rdquo; he said. The
Gamar&#257;la at that also became angry.</p>
<p>Afterwards he asked the son-in-law thus, &ldquo;Where is even my
yoke of cattle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the son-in-law said, &ldquo;They are tied in the chena
jungle.&rdquo; He was angry also concerning that [the cattle being then
dead or nearly so].</p>
<p>For many a day afterwards he remained without talking with the
son-in-law. During the time while he is thus, that daughter who had
been given [in marriage] to an out-village, sent word that [her] father
and brother-in-law, both of them, must come.</p>
<p>Next day that father-in-law having cooked cakes, tied them in a bag,
and having cooked a bundle of rice, tied that also in a bag, in order
to go to the place where the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s elder daughter was
given in marriage. Then he called the son-in-law, saying, &ldquo;Let us
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The son-in-law, taking the cake bag, asked, &ldquo;Father-in-law,
what sort is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father-in-law replied, [jokingly,] &ldquo;There are cobras in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the son-in-law, taking the bag of cooked rice, asked,
&ldquo;Father-in-law, what sort is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father-in-law said, &ldquo;That is for the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the son-in-law, taking the cake bag, went in front; the
father-in-law taking the bundle of cooked rice, went behind. The
father-in-law was unable to go quickly.</p>
<p>The son-in-law while going on and on ate those cakes. At the place
where the cakes were finished he broke open the mouth of the bag, and
setting it on an ant-hill stopped there looking at it.</p>
<p>Then the father-in-law having come up, asked, &ldquo;What,
son-in-law, is that?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href=
"#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span></p>
<p>The son-in-law said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, father-in-law. As
you said those were cobras I placed it on the ant-hill for them to
creep out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards taking the rice bag, also, that was in the hand of the
father-in-law, he again went a long way in front, opened the rice bag,
and ate the cooked rice, and having thrown away the bag, stopped there,
sitting down.</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la having come up, said, &ldquo;Let us eat the bundle
of cooked rice. Where, son-in-law, is the rice bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the son-in-law said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, father-in-law.
As you said that was for the road, I put it on the road and came
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were near a [road-side] shop. At that time, having given the
son-in-law a panama,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6492src" href=
"#xd27e6492" name="xd27e6492src">7</a> the Gamar&#257;la said,
&ldquo;Go to that shop and bring plantains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then having gone to the shop, taking sixteen plantains for the
panama he thought thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Should I take these sixteen
plantains near father-in-law, I shall receive eight plantains [as my
share]. Because of that, I must eat the eight plantains here and
go.&rdquo; Thereupon he ate eight plantains.</p>
<p>Having eaten them, he thinks again, &ldquo;Should I take these eight
plantains father-in-law will not eat them without having given me four
plantains. Because of it, I must eat the four plantains in this very
place.&rdquo; So he ate the four plantains.</p>
<p>Having eaten them, still he thinks, &ldquo;Should I go taking these
four, father-in-law will never eat without giving me two. <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e6501" title="Source: Becau e">Because</span> of it,
after eating the two in this very place I must go.&rdquo; So from the
four he ate two.</p>
<p>Having eaten these, still he thinks, &ldquo;Should I take these two
near father-in-law<a class="noteref" id="n186.2src" href="#n186.2"
name="n186.2src">8</a>, he will never eat without giving me one.
Because of it, I must go after eating one in this very place.&rdquo; So
from the two he ate one.</p>
<p>Having eaten it, still he thinks, &ldquo;Should I take this near
father-in-law<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n186.2">8</a> he will
never eat without giving me a piece. Because of it, I must go after
eating the piece here.&rdquo; So breaking the plantain in two he ate a
piece. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having eaten it, he brought the remaining piece, and gave it to his
father-in-law. Thereupon the Gamar&#257;la asks, &ldquo;Is there [only]
so much plantain, son-in-law?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Then the son-in-law said thus, &ldquo;Father-in-law, I ate my
portion; your portion is that much,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The village at which was the father-in-law&rsquo;s daughter, was
very near. Afterwards the son-in-law said, &ldquo;Father-in-law,
isn&rsquo;t there scarcity of food now everywhere in the country? On
that account it is wrong for us both to go there at the same time. You
come behind; I will go in front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having gone to the place where the daughter was, he said,
&ldquo;Father-in-law is coming there. It is bad for him to eat
anything; he has eaten a medicine. On account of the medicine he is
only eating [paddy] dust porridge; it is bad to eat anything else. On
that account cook quickly a little porridge from paddy dust, and place
it [ready] for him,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, having amply cooked rice and curry for the son-in-law,
she gave him to eat; and for the daughter&rsquo;s father, taking some
of the paddy dust that was in the store-room, she cooked porridge.
While she was looking for him the Gamar&#257;la came; afterwards she
gave him the porridge.</p>
<p>The man, thinking, &ldquo;An&#275;! Our daughter must be without
anything to eat,&rdquo; having eaten a very little of the porridge went
to sleep.</p>
<p>In the night that daughter&rsquo;s girl was crying. Saying, &ldquo;I
want to go and sleep near grandfather,&rdquo; she went to the place
where the man was. Having gone there the girl was crying in the same
way.</p>
<p>Then the son-in-law, hearing her, asked at the man&rsquo;s hand,
&ldquo;What, father-in-law, is that girl crying for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father-in-law, being very sleepy, said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know, son-in-law; we must split her belly,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6537src" href="#xd27e6537" name="xd27e6537src">9</a>
maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the son-in-law, having got up, came to the place where
the girl was, taking a knife, and split the girl&rsquo;s belly.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>Next day, having buried the girl, the father-in-law and the
son-in-law came to their village.</p>
<p>After they went, the son-in-law, having become desirous to eat
cakes, told [his wife] to cook cakes. Thereupon the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s wife said there was no palm sugar. On account of
it, the son-in-law, having become hostile, was minded to go once again
to the village at which the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s elder daughter was
given [in marriage].</p>
<p>Having gone there, he said to the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughter,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Mother-in-law having died, I came here to tell you of
the <i lang="si-latn">pinkama</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6552src"
href="#xd27e6552" name="xd27e6552src">10</a> The pinkama is on the day
after to-morrow. Because of it, cooking a few cakes and the like,
come,&rdquo; he said. Thereupon the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughter
wept.</p>
<p>Then this son-in-law says, &ldquo;What are you crying for? As for
the name &lsquo;crying,&rsquo; we also cried. Through crying you will
not meet with her. Because of it, plucking and setting to ripen a spike
of plantains and the like, and cooking a few cakes, come on the day
after to-morrow.&rdquo; Having said this he came back.</p>
<p>Having come there, he said to the Gamar&#257;la and the whole of the
other persons who were listening, &ldquo;Father-in-law, your daughter
having died, the pinkama is on the day after to-morrow. Because of it,
they said to the whole of you that you are to go [after] plucking and
setting to ripen spikes of plantains, and cooking cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Gamar&#257;la, the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s wife, the
son-in-law, the son-in-law&rsquo;s wife, all having wept and wept,
cooked cakes and milk-rice; and taking ripe plantains, and tying pingo
(carrying-stick) loads of cakes and spikes of plantains, the two
parties went until the time when they came face to face.</p>
<p>When they are coming in contact the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s wife goes
weeping, &ldquo;An&#275;! Daughter, he said you died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the daughter comes weeping, &ldquo;An&#275;! Mother, it is
for your pinkama we came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While both parties, having made lamentation in this manner, are
weeping, the son-in-law who knows the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s
New Speech, said, &ldquo;To-day also you cannot cook cakes! Eat
ye,&rdquo; and began to eat the cakes.</p>
<p>After that, their troubles being allayed, when they asked from this
one, &ldquo;What is this you said?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;This indeed,
father-in-law, is a little of the New Speech. For the purpose of your
getting to know it I did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that all were consoled.</p>

tale called &ldquo;The Story of Hokk&#257;.&rdquo; The hero of it was a
servant of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s. He bought sixteen plantains, and
ate his half share, on his way back repeating the process until only
one was left, which he offered to the Gamar&#257;la. His master
complained of his stupidity in getting only one plantain for the money.
Hokk&#257; replied that he received sixteen, but had eaten the rest.
&ldquo;How did you [dare to] eat them, you dog?&rdquo; asked the
Gamar&#257;la. Hokk&#257; held up the plantain, peeled it, and put it
in his mouth, saying, &ldquo;This is the way I ate the plantains, your
honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i> (Swynnerton), p. 92, a
foolish man who was taking money to the local treasury, put it in some
flour which he handed to a baker&rsquo;s wife to be made into cakes. In
the morning<span class="corr" id="xd27e6589" title="Source: .">,</span>
when he remembered and asked for it, she refused to return it unless he
told her two stories this way and two that way, and as he could think
of none he went off without it. When his clever brother heard of it, he
put some brass finger-rings into flour, handed it to the same woman,
and in reply to her remarks stated that there were many rings at the
bush where he picked these. When she went to pick some, thinking them
gold, the man told her husband that she had followed a man who beckoned
to her, the husband took a bamboo and gave her a sound beating. The
clever brother, learning that the baker&rsquo;s daughter was betrothed
to a lad at another village, told a person whom he met to inform the
boy&rsquo;s parents that the girl had died from snake-bite; he himself
told the girl&rsquo;s mother that wolves had attacked and killed the
lad. The two mothers met on the way, quarrelled and fought, and became
reconciled on finding the reports false. The brother told the
baker&rsquo;s wife that he had now told her two stories this way, and
she was glad to give him his brother&rsquo;s money before he told her
two that way.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. i, p. 289, a barber whose wife was visited by a King pretended to
be sick, and informed the King that his wife was a witch who extracted
and sucked his entrails while he slept, and then replaced them. When
the barber went home he told his wife that his razor had broken on some
abnormal and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>very sharp teeth of the King&rsquo;s. When the
King came, and the barber&rsquo;s wife stretched out her hand to find
the teeth, the King cried, &ldquo;A witch! A witch!&rdquo; and
escaped.</p>
<p>In the <i>Arabian Nights</i> (Lady Burton&rsquo;s ed., vol. i, p.
355) a negro slave related how when his master sent him home for some
article, he informed his wife and daughters that his master had been
killed by the fall of an old wall. They rent their robes, overturned
the furniture, and broke the windows and crockery, the slave assisting
them. Then, led by him, they and the neighbours went lamenting to bring
the body home. The Governor also took labourers with spades and
baskets. The slave got ahead, told the master that his house had fallen
and killed his wife, daughters, and everything else. While his master
and his friends were lamenting and tearing their robes the procession
of mourners arrived and the hoax was discovered. The Governor made the
slave &ldquo;eat stick&rdquo; till he fainted.</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol.
ii, p. 211, a man who was sent by his master to buy mangoes, only sweet
and fine ones, tasted each one to ascertain if it was of the requisite
quality. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=

<h2 class="main">How the Son-in-law Cut the Chena</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a woman and a man, it
is said. There is a daughter of those two persons. Having brought a man
to the house for the girl, he stayed there.</p>
<p>One day the father-in-law said to the son-in-law, &ldquo;[After]
asking for a <i lang="si-latn">Naekata</i> (a lucky hour, depending on
the positions of the planets), and returning, prepare to cut a little
jungle [for making a chena].&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the son-in-law went near the Naekatr&#257;la
(astrologer) and asked for a naekata. Then the Naekatr&#257;la said,
&ldquo;The naekata will be on Thursday&rdquo; (<i lang=
"si-latn">Burahaspotind&#257;</i>, <i>sic</i>).</p>
<p>Afterwards the son-in-law, saying, &ldquo;Burah&#257;s,
burah&#257;s,&rdquo; comes away. The path on which to come is along the
[front of the] Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house; except that, there is no
other path. When he is coming away along the [front of the]
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house, the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s dog comes
growling (<i lang="si-latn">bur&#257;na</i>) in front of him. Well
then, the son-in-law forgets the naekata.</p>
<p>Well then, having gone back again near the Naekatr&#257;la, he said,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Naekatr&#257;la, not having remembered the day I have
come here again.&rdquo; Then the Naekatr&#257;la says, &ldquo;Why do
you forget; didn&rsquo;t I say Thursday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the son-in-law, again saying and saying, &ldquo;Burah&#257;s,
burah&#257;s,&rdquo; is coming away along the [front of the]
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house, the dog comes growling. Well then, again
this man forgets the naekat day.</p>
<p>Again having gone near the Naekatr&#257;la, he asks him. Thus, in
that manner, that day until it becomes night he walks there and here.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>Afterwards the Naekatr&#257;la said, &ldquo;What has happened to you
that you are forgetting in that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this son-in-law says, &ldquo;What is it, Naekatr&#257;la?
Isn&rsquo;t it because of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s dog? What
else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Naekatr&#257;la said, &ldquo;Why do you become unable [to
remember] because of the dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This son-in-law replies, &ldquo;When I am going from here saying and
saying, &lsquo;Burah&#257;s, burah&#257;s,&rsquo; along the [front of
the] Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house, that dog comes in front of me
growling. Well then, I forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Naekatr&#257;la having given into the man&rsquo;s hand a cudgel,
said, &ldquo;Should the dog come, beat it with this;&rdquo; and saying,
&ldquo;The day is Thursday,&rdquo; sent him away.</p>
<p>After that, the man came home in the manner the Naekatr&#257;la
said. That day was Wednesday; the next day, indeed, was the naekata. On
that day he said to the man&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;To-morrow, indeed, is
the naekata, Thursday. Early in the morning you must make ready a
bundle of cooked rice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following day the woman cooked a bundle of rice and gave him
it. The man, having taken the bundle of cooked rice and hung it on a
tree, clearing at the tree only [sufficient] for the man to lie down,
slept there until the time when it becomes noon. At noon, bathing in
water and returning, he ate the bundle of cooked rice; and having been
sleeping there again until the time when it becomes night, he came home
in the evening. Thus, in that way, until the time comes for setting
fire to the jungle, he ate the bundles of cooked rice.</p>
<p>Then when men told the son-in-law they were going to set fire to the
jungle [at their chenas] he said, &ldquo;Father-in-law, I must set fire
to my jungle. I cannot quite alone. If you go too it will be
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the father-in-law said, &ldquo;H&#257;, if so, let us
go,&rdquo; and taking a blind (smouldering) torch, and taking also a
bundle of [unlit] torches, the father-in-law quite loaded, the
son-in-law empty-handed in front, they go on and on, without end.</p>
<p>The father-in-law said, &ldquo;Where, son-in-law, are we going
still?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p>The son-in-law says, &ldquo;Still a little further. Come
along.&rdquo; Having said this, and gone near the tree where he ate the
rice, a buffalo was asleep in the place which he had cleared and had
been sleeping at. The son-in-law, cutting a stick, came and struck the
buffalo, and drove it away, saying, &ldquo;What did you come to sleep
in my chena for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the father-in-law asked, &ldquo;Where, son-in-law, is the
chena?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The son-in-law says, &ldquo;And&#333;! Father-in-law, this
Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6702src" href=
"#xd27e6702" name="xd27e6702src">1</a> buffalo was sleeping in one part
that I had cut. The others men stole and went off with,
maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the father-in-law, having become angry, came home.</p>

<h2 class="main">A Girl and a Step-mother</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain time, at a village there was a certain
Gamar&#257;la. There was a daughter of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s. The
daughter&rsquo;s mother died. After she died, for the Gamar&#257;la
they brought another [woman in] marriage. Of the previous <i lang=
"si-latn">d&#299;ga</i> (marriage) of that woman there is a girl. The
woman and the girl are not good to the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s
daughter.</p>
<p>At the time when the Gamar&#257;la is not [there], she tells the two
girls to clean cotton. She told that step-mother&rsquo;s daughter to
remain at the corner of the house, and clean the cotton. She told the
daughter of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s previous marriage to clean cotton
in the lower part of the garden, under the lime tree. Having told her
to clean it, the step-mother says, &ldquo;Should a roll of cotton go
away through the wind I will split thy head,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>When with fear on account of it, the [Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s] girl is
cleaning the cotton, a great wind having struck her, all the small
quantity of cotton went away owing to the wind. The step-mother saw
that the cotton is going. Having seen it, she went and said to the
girl, &ldquo;Why did&rsquo;st thou send away the cotton in the wind?
Thou canst not remain here. Thou having gone near the female Bear,
[after] begging for the golden spindle (<i lang="si-latn">ran
idda</i>), the golden bow for cleaning cotton (<i lang="si-latn">ran
rodda</i>), the golden spindle (<i lang="si-latn">ran wawnna</i>), the
golden spinning-wheel (<i lang="si-latn">ran yantar&#275;</i>), feed
the seven mouths of the Seven-mouthed Prince and get a living. Unless
[thou dost] that, thou canst not obtain a living here.&rdquo; Having
said [this], she beat her.</p>
<p>The girl, hearing the word which her step-mother said, went near the
female Bear, and asking for [and obtaining] <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>the
female Bear&rsquo;s golden spindle, golden cotton-bow, golden spindle,
golden spinning-wheel, went to the place where the Seven-mouthed Prince
is. The Seven-mouthed Prince is a human-flesh-eating man; there are
seven mouths for that man.</p>
<p>At the time when the girl was arriving there, the Seven-mouthed
Prince had not come back since he went<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6745src" href="#xd27e6745" name="xd27e6745src">1</a> to eat human
flesh. This girl having hastened, having cooked seven quarts of rice
and seven curries, and covered those things and placed [them ready],
remained hidden when the Seven-mouthed Prince was coming.</p>
<p>The Seven-mouthed Prince having come, when he looked some rice and
curry had been cooked. The Seven-mouthed Prince asks, &ldquo;Who has
cooked these?&rdquo; The girl does not speak about it. After that, the
Seven-mouthed Prince having prepared himself, ate the whole of the
cooked rice and curry. Having eaten, and having been sleeping, on the
following day, in the morning, he went for human-flesh food.</p>
<p>Having waited until the time when he goes, the girl that day having
cooked six quarts of rice, and having cooked six curries, cleaned and
swept the house, and that day also got hid. That day also, having come,
he asked in that manner [who had done it]. That day, also, she did not
speak. That day he obliterated one mouth.</p>
<p>In this order, until the time when it became one quart, she cooked
and gave him to eat. Out of the seven mouths he obliterated six; one
remained over. On that day, having cooked in the day a half [quart] of
rice, and cooked two curries, and having warmed and placed water for
the Seven-mouthed Prince to bathe, and taken another sort of cloth [for
him], she placed those things [ready] for him. Having expressed oil,
she placed it [ready for him]. That day the Seven-mouthed Prince having
come, says, &ldquo;Come down, person who is assisting me.&rdquo; Having
said it, he called her. After that, the girl came. After she came, he
asked, &ldquo;What is the reason of your assisting me in this
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl tells him. The girl says, &ldquo;I have no
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>mother; father has brought a step-mother. That
step-mother having beaten me said, &lsquo;Thou canst not be here and
obtain a living. Thou having gone near the female Bear, [after] begging
for the female Bear&rsquo;s golden spindle, golden cotton bow, golden
spinning-wheel, golden spindle, go near the Seven-mouthed Prince, and
feeding the seven mouths obtain a living. Except that, thou canst not
get a living here,&rsquo; she said. Owing to that I came,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>Afterwards he became much pleased about it. Having become pleased he
told her to stay [as his wife]. Afterwards having called the Prince,
and caused him to bathe in warm water, and caused him to put on good
cloths, and rubbed oil [on his hair], and combed his head, that day the
two sitting down ate cooked rice.</p>
<p>From that time, the party became rich there to a good degree. The
girl&rsquo;s father, and step-mother, and step-mother&rsquo;s girl,
having gone to the place where she is, obtained a subsistence from
there.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a woman and a man, it
is said. There is a younger sister of the man. The elder
brother&rsquo;s wife is very dear to the younger sister; the younger
sister is a very good girl.</p>
<p>One day the elder brother said at the hand of the woman, &ldquo;It
is in my mind to call my younger sister [to be my wife].&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman says, &ldquo;Well, what is it to me, if it be good to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she was there, the woman having placed paddy on the hearth,
and waited until the time when it is boiling, said to that
sister-in-law, &ldquo;Sister-in-law, having gone rubbing castor-oil on
your two legs take out the paddy that is on the hearth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman combed the man&rsquo;s head. She said it to the girl
unnoticed by the man, to save the girl.</p>
<p>That girl having gone rubbing her two legs, when she was taking out
the paddy the heat of the fire on the hearth struck her two legs, and
the castor-oil, having become warm, descends down her two legs. Then
that woman, having been combing and combing the man&rsquo;s head, says
at the hand of the man, &ldquo;There! You say it is in your mind to
call your younger sister [to be your wife]. Look there, at the matter
from her legs; her legs are ulcerated.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6796src" href="#xd27e6796" name="xd27e6796src">1</a></p>
<p>Then the man says, &ldquo;It is unnecessary to keep that one;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>you take that one, and having taken this
bill-hook cut that one&rsquo;s neck, and come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the woman, calling her sister-in-law and having gone,
handed her over to a widow woman, and having secretly taken that
man&rsquo;s money also, gave it to the widow woman for her expenses on
account of the girl.</p>
<p>While returning, she cut a dog on the path, and smearing the blood
on the bill-hook, came back and showed it to the man, &ldquo;Look here
(<i lang="si-latn">Menna</i>). The blood that has been cut from your
younger sister.&rdquo; Well then, to the man&rsquo;s mind it is
good.</p>
<p>At the time when the man is not at home, having cut a tunnel from
the woman&rsquo;s house to the widow woman&rsquo;s house, and from the
woman&rsquo;s house to the widow woman&rsquo;s house having drawn a
silver chain and an iron chain, she said at the hand of the widow
woman, &ldquo;If there be a sorrow shake the iron chain; if there be a
pleasure shake the silver chain.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6813src" href="#xd27e6813" name="xd27e6813src">2</a> Having said
it the woman came home.</p>
<p>On a certain day the girl arrived at marriageable age. The widow
woman shook the silver chain. Afterwards, this girl having gone
[there], when she looked the girl had arrived at a marriageable age;
and having distributed the present given to the washerman on the
occasion, and the like, she again said at the hand of the widow woman,
&ldquo;If there be a pleasure, shake the silver chain; if a sorrow,
shake the iron chain,&rdquo; and came home again.</p>
<p>Again one day she shook the silver chain. This woman having gone
again, when she looked [she found that] to give the girl [in marriage]
the name [of the man] had been decided. Afterwards, having distributed
the [food of the] wedding [feast] and the like, the woman came
home.</p>
<p>The girl having been [married] a little time, bore a boy. Afterwards
the girl said to the girl&rsquo;s man, &ldquo;Tying pingo
(carrying-stick) loads, let us go to our village.&rdquo; The man also
having said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; cooking cakes, and carrying the
little one also, they came to the widow woman&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Then the widow woman shook the silver chain. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=

when she looked the girl&rsquo;s little one is there also.</p>
<p>Having given from the cakes to the widow woman, she took the others,
and calling the girl, calling the girl&rsquo;s husband also, and
carrying the little one, she returned home [with them]. Having gone
home, the girl&rsquo;s sister-in-law caused the little one to lie in
the waist pocket of the girl&rsquo;s elder brother, and said,
&ldquo;There. Your younger sister&rsquo;s little one!&rdquo; [and told
him how she had been saved].</p>
<p>After that, the elder brother having wept, took the little one in
his arms.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a woman and a man, it
is said. While they were there the woman bore two girls and a boy. When
they were there a long time the man died.</p>
<p>After that, the big girl having grown up, they gave her in <i lang=
"si-latn">d&#299;ga</i> (marriage). The boy cannot speak well; his nose
is short. The other girl has become considerably big. That boy is older
than the girl. It is Nahako&#7789;&#257;&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6847src" href="#xd27e6847" name="xd27e6847src">1</a> endeavour to
call that younger sister [in marriage]. That woman (their mother)
having perceived that, went with the daughter to the place where the
other big daughter was given; and having conducted her [there], came
back.</p>
<p>After that, a day or two having passed, Nahako&#7789;&#257; went, in
order to call the girl back [to be his wife]. Having gone [he said] at
the girl&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;Younger sister, mother told me to go back
with thee; on that account I came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While coming with that girl, having met with villages on the road
that girl says, &ldquo;Elder brother, is our village still far
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Nahako&#7789;&#257; says, &ldquo;Why do you say, &lsquo;Elder
brother, elder brother?&rsquo; Would it be bad if you said,
&lsquo;Husband, husband&rsquo; (<i lang=
"si-latn">W&#257;h&#275;</i>)?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then that girl being frightened, comes without speaking. Again, when
coming a little further, she asks, &ldquo;Elder brother, is our village
still far away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Nahako&#7789;&#257; says, &ldquo;Why do you say, &lsquo;Elder
brother, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>elder brother?&rsquo; Would it be bad if you
said, &lsquo;Husband, husband?&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl being frightened comes without speaking. Thus, in that
way they came quite home. Having come, Nahako&#7789;&#257; said to
Nahako&#7789;&#257;&rsquo;s mother, &ldquo;Mother, pound flour and cook
cakes. I am going to spread nets to catch [animals] for my [wedding]
feast.&rdquo; Having said it, Nahako&#7789;&#257; went to spread nets,
joining with a man.</p>
<p>After that, the girl says, &ldquo;Mother, when elder brother and I
were coming, I asked at elder brother&rsquo;s hand, &lsquo;Elder
brother, is our village still further on?&rsquo; Then elder brother
said, &lsquo;Why do you say, &ldquo;Elder brother, elder
brother?&rdquo; If you said, &ldquo;Husband, husband,&rdquo; would it
be bad?&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the woman says, &ldquo;Daughter, let us two go somewhere
or other before that one comes.&rdquo; Having said it, and cut the
throat (<i>lit.</i>, neck) of a cock, and hung it above the hearth, and
placed a cooking-pot on the hearth, and blown the fire, and shut the
house door, the woman and the girl went somewhere or other.</p>
<p>Nahako&#7789;&#257;, having spread nets, came home. While he was in
the veranda, as the blood of the fowl [hanging] in that house was
falling into the cooking-pot, the pot having become heated, for three
watches (each of four hours) when each drop of blood was falling it
makes a noise, &ldquo;C&#333;s, c&#333;s,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Nahako&#7789;&#257; thought, &ldquo;Our mother, etc., cooking cakes,
indeed, that is.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6888src" href=
"#xd27e6888" name="xd27e6888src">3</a> Having sprung into the open

at the door and told them to open the door. They did not open it.</p>
<p>Afterwards, having opened the door, when he looked there was nobody.
A cock, only, was hung near the hearth, a cooking-pot placed on the
hearth, only the fire is blazing on the hearth.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Nahako&#7789;&#257; having wept, remained there
quietly.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6905src" href="#xd27e6905" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a woman and a man, it
is said. The woman having falsely said that she had the Ka&#7693;awara
disease,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6922src" href="#xd27e6922" name=
"xd27e6922src">1</a> taking on false illness lay down. The man every
day goes to the watch-hut [in the chena].</p>
<p>One day when he was going to the watch-hut, he asked for thread at
the hand of the woman, in order to bring it on the morrow morning,
[after] charming it for the Ka&#7693;awara. After that, the woman gave
him thread, having become pleased at it.</p>
<p>The man knows about the woman&rsquo;s trickery. Knowing it, that day
evening having gone to the watch-hut the man charmed the thread. How
did he charm it? The woman&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s name was
Palin&#774;guw&#257;.</p>
<p>At the very time when the man was going to sleep, holding the
thread, the very manner in which he charmed it [was this]: having made
[nine] knots [on it], he charmed it [by] saying and saying [only],
&ldquo;Palin&#774;guw&#257;&rsquo;s woman, Palin&#774;guw&#257;&rsquo;s
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following day morning he came back, and tied it on the
woman&rsquo;s arm. At the very instant, the woman, quickly having
arisen, does her work. While she was thus, the woman says,
&ldquo;Having hastened quickly, you must distribute
[betel].&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6933src" href="#xd27e6933"
name="xd27e6933src">2</a></p>
<p>Afterwards, the man also having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; he
gave betel to Ka&#7693;awara Ved&#257;s<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6938src" href="#xd27e6938" name="xd27e6938src">3</a> who dance
well, and said, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205"
name="pb205">205</a>]</span>&ldquo;Come on such and such a day.&rdquo;
He collected for it the articles to be expended, and caused arrack
(spirit distilled from palm-juice) to be brought, and prepared all.</p>
<p>On the Ka&#7693;awara day the men came, and having eaten and drunk,
and dressed themselves [in their dancing costume and ornaments], as
they were descending [from the raised veranda] into the open space in
front of the house, this woman quickly took out the mat also, and
stretching out her two feet at the doorway, sat down on it, (ready for
the ceremony, which would be performed in front of her).</p>
<p>Then this man having come speedily, bringing the rice pestle, beat
that woman with the pestle and put her in the house. Having shut the
door and locked it, and come outside, as he was coming out the
Ka&#7693;awara Ved&#257;s, becoming afraid, prepared to run away,
saying, &ldquo;Perhaps this man is a mad-man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this man said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you run away. Dance well.
There is arrack; drink as much as you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, they having drunk and drunk and danced until it became
light, in the morning the man cooked abundantly, and gave the
Ka&#7693;awara Ved&#257;s to eat, and having given them presents sent
them away.</p>

two persons. During the time while they were [there], one day the
husband said to the woman, &ldquo;I am going to-day to the watch-hut.
Having gone there, I shall not come back to-morrow morning; I shall be
delayed, ploughing the field below that field. Because of it, you must
bring me cooked rice to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

it became light. After that, the woman went to sleep.</p>
<p>[After] going to sleep, being without the means of bringing cooked
rice [through want of time to cook it], she washed rice, putting it in
a cooking-pot, and cut up dried fish and brinjal,<a class="noteref" id=

her [for being late].</p>
<p>Thereupon, this woman, saying, &ldquo;Apoyi! Because you said such a
vile word to me may the cooked rice and curry which I brought for you
become raw,&rdquo; put them down on the ground.</p>
<p>When the man looked, the woman&rsquo;s speech was true; the cooked
rice and curry had become raw. After that, the man, having said to the
woman that she was a good woman, thoroughly respected her.</p>

paramour has become associated with the woman.</p>
<p>She said to the woman&rsquo;s husband, &ldquo;In our country there
is a custom. In the lower part of the garden we must offer cakes to the
Yak&#257; who is in the lower part of the garden; if not, the Yak&#257;
causes sickness. When I was living at my village, too, I offered them
every day. Because of it, we must offer them now also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the man said, &ldquo;H&#257;, it is good. Continue to
offer them. For it, what else do you want, etc.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the woman said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want anything
else. Having set up two sticks, cleft into four at the top (<i lang=

thirty cakes. That is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having cooked the cakes, on the day on which she offers them she
cannot cook more [food]. At the house no one can eat [afterwards on
that day]; should they eat they will die.</p>
<p>After that, the man having prepared the two cleft sticks in the
lower part of the garden, gave her them. From that day, the woman
having cooked fifty cakes, at one cleft stick offers twenty, at one
cleft stick thirty.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7044src" href=

<p>The paramour having come, leaving the twenty, eats the thirty, and
goes away. Afterwards the woman having come [there], eats the twenty,
and goes back.</p>
<p>In that very manner, the woman every day having given cakes to that
paramour, the woman also eats. That man was unable to find out the
roguery.</p>

Figure</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a woman and a man, it
is said; the woman is associated with a paramour. The woman has been
brought from another country.</p>
<p>One day (<i lang="si-latn">dawasakd&#257;</i>) the woman said,
&ldquo;In our country there is a custom. Having constructed a flour
figure, and having made it sit upon a chair near the hearth, we must
cook cakes and offer them [before it].&rdquo; After that, the man
having sought for the articles for cooking cakes gave her them.</p>
<p>After that, the woman, having pounded flour and made [enough] for
two cooking pots, having increased the syrup for one pot, and
diminished the syrup for one, and having been there until the time when
the man goes somewhere or other (<i lang="si-latn">kohed&#333;</i>),
told the paramour to come. After having put and smeared flour over the
whole body<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7084src" href="#xd27e7084" name=
"xd27e7084src">1</a> of the man, having brought a chair near the hearth
and made him sit upon the chair, the woman sitting down near the hearth
cooks the cakes.</p>
<p>That man having come home, when he looked there is the flour figure.
While the man in silence is looking on in the raised veranda, having
seen that the woman puts the well-cooked cakes separately into a pot
and the badly cooked cakes into another pot, and getting to know about
the flour figure paramour, to make the woman get up of
necessity,&mdash;a calf had been brought from the woman&rsquo;s
village&mdash;the calf had been tied up,&mdash;the man having gone very
quietly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>(<i lang="si-latn">himimma</i>) unfastened the
calf. Very quietly having come again to the veranda he said,
&ldquo;&#332;n&#805; (there)! The calf that was brought from your
village is loose; tie it and come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman says, &ldquo;I am unable to go;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7097src" href="#xd27e7097" name="xd27e7097src">2</a> you go and
tie it, and come.&rdquo; The man said, &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the woman having arisen went to tie the calf. [Then] this
man, having arisen from the veranda, struck the oil cooking-pot that
was on the hearth on the top of the head (<i lang=
"si-latn">ismun&#774;dun&#275;</i>) of the flour figure paramour. The
flour figure, crying out, is wriggling about.</p>
<p>That woman having tied up the calf and come, says, &ldquo;I had
prepared the flour figure. Having thrown it away that one will have
come and sat there [in its place]. What shall I do? [When] he escaped
from you even so much [time], am I indeed going to eat that one&rsquo;s
liver?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7112src" href="#xd27e7112" name=
"xd27e7112src">3</a> Why didn&rsquo;t you split that one&rsquo;s
head?&rdquo; Having said [this] she caused the man to be deceived.</p>

<p class="first">The woman&rsquo;s remark regarding the liver is an
instance of the survival of a very old expression, perhaps connected
with magical practices. In the translations from the Chinese
Tripi&#7789;aka published by M. Chavannes in <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents
Contes et Apologues</i>, vol. i, p. 120, a girl cried, &ldquo;May I
become a demoniacal and maleficent being to devour the liver of the
elder brother.&rdquo; In <i>Folk-lore of the Santal Parganas</i> (Rev.
Dr. Bodding), p. 419, it is stated that witches are believed to cause
people&rsquo;s deaths by eating their livers. The Sinhalese text is,
&ldquo;<i lang="si-latn">Um&#774;bawaen occarawat b&#275;ruwa mama
nan&#805; &#333;kage kaewtu kanaw&#257; n&#257;e?</i>&rdquo; The final
word is merely a colloquial expletive which adds emphasis to the
question. It occurs also in No. 197, vol. iii, footnote No. 1, and
elsewhere. Perhaps this is the original form of the curious syllable
sometimes heard at the end of questions put to acquaintances by
Burghers of the lower class in Ceylon, as in the query, &ldquo;I say,
man, what are you doing, n&#335;?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain village there were an elder sister and a
younger brother, it is said. He gave the elder sister<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7146src" href="#xd27e7146" name="xd27e7146src">2</a> in
<i lang="si-latn">d&#299;ga</i> [marriage] to a [man of another]
country. For the younger brother they brought a wife to the house.</p>
<p>When no long time had gone after the elder sister was given in
d&#299;ga, the elder sister&rsquo;s husband died; and being without
[anything] to eat or drink, the elder sister came to the younger
brother&rsquo;s house in order to beg for something.</p>
<p>At that time, the man said, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Give our elder
sister amply to eat and drink, and having tied up and given a bag of
paddy amounting to a load, send her on her journey;&rdquo; and in order
to look at his wife&rsquo;s trustworthiness or untrustworthiness he
stayed in a tree behind the house, looking out, near the path on which
the elder sister goes.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the man&rsquo;s wife, having given the man&rsquo;s elder
sister a piece of stale cake to eat, put in a [mat] box a little
worthless paddy chaff that had been blown away when she fanned paddy,
and gave her it.</p>
<p>After that, when this elder sister, being grieved, was going on the
path, she went saying and saying, &ldquo;An&#275;! If my younger
brother were there she would not do thus. Sister-in-law gave me only
paddy chaff and a few stale cakes; but [even] should my sister-in-law
do magic against me, may a shower of flowers rain at my younger
brother&rsquo;s doorway.&rdquo; Then, weeping and weeping she came
home.</p>
<p>Then the younger brother who stayed in the tree having been hearing
that word, came home, and asked his wife, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Didst
thou give my elder sister amply to eat and drink?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;And&#333;ma! When she had eaten I tied up a
bag of paddy equal to a load, and gave it. What else will you tell me
to give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the man having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and having
been keeping it in his mind, after two or three days had gone, said,
&ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Thy mother is ill. Prepare something and give me
it [as a present for her, to enable me] to look at her and
return,&rdquo; he said. The man said it falsely.</p>
<p>The woman saying, &ldquo;Perhaps it is true,&rdquo; cooked a packet
of rice, and taking thirty rid&#299;s,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7169src" href="#xd27e7169" name="xd27e7169src">3</a> put them at
the bottom of the packet of cooked rice, and tied and gave him it, for
him to go to her parents&rsquo; house and return. Unknown to the
man<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7205src" href="#xd27e7205" name=
"xd27e7205src">4</a> she did this dishonesty (<i>i.e.</i>, put his
money in the bag).</p>
<p>Thereupon the man, taking the packet of cooked rice, went to the
house of the man&rsquo;s elder sister. That day he remained there
without coming back.</p>
<p>That elder sister having unfastened the bag, when she looked [saw
that] at the bottom of the rice there were thirty rid&#299;s.
Afterwards the elder sister called the younger brother and asked,
&ldquo;Younger brother, whence are these thirty rid&#299;s at the
bottom of the rice in this bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger brother said, &ldquo;I told her of our house (<i lang=
"si-latn">ap&#275; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214"
name="pb214">214</a>]</span>gedara &#275;k&#299;</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7233src" href="#xd27e7233" name="xd27e7233src">5</a>) to cook
and give me a packet of rice, in order to go to her village. She will
have put in the thirty rid&#299;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time a washerwoman who stayed in that village brought
clothes to the younger brother&rsquo;s house. Thereupon this woman (his
wife) asked at the hand of the washerwoman (<i lang=
"si-latn">radaw&#299; atin</i>), &ldquo;Washerwoman-aunt, our house man
went to go to [my] village and return. Didn&rsquo;t you meet him on the
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The washerwoman said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Madam (<i lang=
"si-latn">mahattin&#275;</i>), on the road indeed I did not meet with
him; he is staying at the gentleman&rsquo;s (<i lang=
"si-latn">r&#257;hamill&#275;</i>) elder sister&rsquo;s house. Except
that it seemed that he is<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7249src" href=
"#xd27e7249" name="xd27e7249src">6</a> at the house itself, he did not
[otherwise] go to your quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, at that instant<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7255src" href=
"#xd27e7255" name="xd27e7255src">7</a> a disturbance (internal) having
come to her, while this woman was saying, &ldquo;Is it true,
washerwoman? Is it true, washerwoman? Saw you him, washerwoman? Saw you
him, washerwoman? Gave he them, washerwoman? Got she them, washerwoman?
There are thirty rid&#299;s, there are thirty, there are
thirty,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7263src" href="#xd27e7263"
name="xd27e7263src">8</a> except that she got her breath upwards, she
did not hold it down. Having gone in that very manner, when she said
there were thirty rid&#299;s she became a female Red-wattled
Lapwing,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7269src" href="#xd27e7269" name=
"xd27e7269src">9</a> and flew away. Now also the Red-wattled Lapwings
say, &ldquo;<i lang="si-latn">Ho&#7789;&#257;e &#7789;ikiri,

time, indeed, the Red-wattled Lapwings increased.</p>
<p>Then the man having come back, not contracting another marriage he
remained providing subsistence for his elder sister.</p>

<i>Lit.</i>, &ldquo;silvers.&rdquo; In the <i>Arabian Nights</i> (Lady
Burton&rsquo;s ed., vol. i, p. 234) there is a similar expression
denoting silver coins: &ldquo;I gave the servant a few silvers.&rdquo;
The <i lang="si-latn">rid&#299;</i> or larin is the silver wire
&ldquo;hook-money,&rdquo; at first imported from the Persian Gulf,
where it was coined in L&#257;rist&#257;n, but afterwards made in
Ceylon. Captain Robert Knox says of it, &ldquo;There is another sort,
which all People by the King&rsquo;s Permission may and do make. The
shape is like a fish-hook, they stamp what mark or impression on it
they please&rdquo; (<i>Hist. Relation of Ceylon</i>, 1681, p. 97).
Baldaeus remarked, &ldquo;The most current coin here are the silver
Laryns each whereof is worth about tenpence &hellip; as well in
<i>Ceylon</i> as <i>Malabar</i> two golden <i>Fanams</i>, at five-pence
a piece, make a <i>Laryn</i>&rdquo; (<i>A Description of y<sup>e</sup>
East India Coasts, etc.</i>, translation, 1672, p. 727<span class=

I was informed that three rid&#299;s were equal to one rupee. Further

<p class="first">In a certain country, when seven elder sisters and
younger sisters, fastening on bangles (<i lang="si-latn">at-wael</i>)
are going along, a woman having been near the well asked, &ldquo;Where
are they<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7307src" href="#xd27e7307" name=

<p>Then the seven elder sisters and younger sisters said, &ldquo;We are
going to seek for ourselves seven elder brothers and younger
brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this woman said, &ldquo;There are seven elder brothers and
younger brothers of mine.&rdquo; Having said, &ldquo;Let us go, if so,
to our house,&rdquo; and having gone calling the seven persons and sent
them to seven houses (rooms), she lowered [from the corn store] seven
[mat] boxes of paddy, and gave them.</p>
<p>The seven persons having boiled the paddy, and said,
&ldquo;Sister-in-law, look after this,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

it out to dry, the seven went for firewood. Having gone there they
spoke, &ldquo;Let us find a means<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7321src"
href="#xd27e7321" name="xd27e7321src">4</a> of killing
sister-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a Brown Monkey (<i lang="si-latn">rilaw&#257;</i>);
catching the monkey they brought it home.</p>
<p>This younger sister having gone to sleep and a great rain having
rained, all the paddy was washed away.<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=

had been washed away.</p>
<p>After that, the seven persons again having lowered paddy [from the
corn-store], when they were pounding the paddy raw (<i>lit.</i>, hard)
that younger sister awoke. Having awoke thus, she asked at the hand of
those seven, &ldquo;Sister-in-law, is there cooked rice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the women said, &ldquo;Is there cooked rice in our hand? It is
in the cooking pot, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; The women having previously
(<i>lit.</i>, betimes) broken up bits of potsherds, and put them in the
drinking kettle, and put it away, are pounding paddy.</p>
<p>Afterwards that sister-in-law having gone and eaten the cooked rice,
and said, &ldquo;Sister-in-law, give me water,&rdquo; these women said,
&ldquo;Is it in our hand? It is in the house, in the drinking kettle;
take it and drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the sister-in-law having taken the drinking kettle, when
she was drinking the water the pieces of potsherds stuck in her
throat.</p>
<p>These seven persons spoke, &ldquo;Should that one&rsquo;s elder
brothers come, indeed, we shall be unable to kill her. Before they come
let us kill her.&rdquo; Having spoken thus, and having put the
sister-in-law and that monkey into a bag and tied it, they hung it at
the ridge pole. Having hung it, after the seven persons were pounding
paddy the seven strike seven blows with the rice pestles at the bag. At
the number they are striking, that monkey, jumping and jumping,
scratches that woman who is in the bag. He having scratched her,
afterwards blood descends from the bag. Then the seven persons having
said, &ldquo;Now then, it is bad [for her] to be [thus]; having
released her let us put her down,&rdquo; having unfastened the bag, put
down the sister-in-law at the veranda.</p>
<p>Then the sister-in-law&rsquo;s elder brothers came home. Having come
there the eldest brother asked, &ldquo;Where is our younger
sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then these seven women said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. Having gone
behind Ro&#7693;iy&#257;s, and her caste having [thus] fallen, there!
she is weeping and weeping in the direction of the veranda.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=

<p>Afterwards the eldest elder brother having gone, &ldquo;What,
younger sister, happened to you?&rdquo; he asked at the hand of the
younger sister.</p>
<p>The younger sister cannot speak, because a sharp piece of potsherd
has stuck in her throat. The whole seven elder brothers having gone,
spoke [to her]. Because she did not speak, the eldest elder brother
said, &ldquo;Who can cut [and kill] this younger sister?&rdquo; The
whole five other elder brothers said they could not; the young elder
brother said, &ldquo;I indeed can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said it, causing them to cook a bundle of rice, calling the
younger sister also, and taking the sword, and taking the bundle of
cooked rice, he went [with her] to a forest jungle (<i lang=
"si-latn">him&#257;l&#275;ka&#7789;a</i>). Having gone there he said to
the younger sister, &ldquo;Younger sister, [for me] to look for lice on
your head lie down.&rdquo; Afterwards the younger sister lay down; well
then, the elder brother began to smash the lice. Then sleep went to the
younger sister.</p>
<p>Afterwards the elder brother having placed the younger
sister&rsquo;s head very softly on the ground, and having cut a
Rat-snake on the path he was coming on, [after] smearing the blood on
the sword he showed the sword to the people who were at home.</p>
<p>Afterwards that younger sister having awoke, when she looked her
elder brother was not [there], in the midst of the forest. Well then,
weeping and weeping, taking also the bundle of cooked rice, having
bounded to a path she began to go.</p>
<p>Having gone thus,&mdash;there is a city called &ldquo;The City the
R&#257;kshasa eats&rdquo;; there is an alms-hall at that
city,&mdash;having gone, she arrived there. There, having eaten that
bundle of cooked rice, and having joined herself to the people who are
giving alms, she began to give alms.</p>
<p>The eyes of the whole of these seven elder brothers and seven women
became blind. After that, news reached those persons that there is an
alms-hall of the city the R&#257;kshasa eats. After that, they very
fourteen persons went near the alms-hall.</p>
<p>That sister-in-law also having gone in a d&#299;ga [marriage],
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>has borne a child also. She having given food to
this party, when that sister-in-law and the sister-in-law&rsquo;s child
were preparing (<i>lit.</i>, making) to sleep, the child said to the
sister-in-law, &ldquo;Mother, for me to hear it tell me a
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the sister-in-law [said], &ldquo;Son, what do I know? I will
tell you the things indeed that happened to me.&rdquo; So the son said,
&ldquo;It is good, tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards she told him all the matters that occurred to this
sister-in-law. Those seven elder brothers having heard the things she
says, and having said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Our younger sister to-day is
relating our grandeur!&rdquo; as soon as they gave the salutation
&ldquo;S&#257;dhu!&rdquo; the eyes of the whole seven elder brothers
became clear.</p>
<p>The eyes of the seven women did not become clear. The seven elder
brothers also stayed at the very city at which is the younger sister.
The seven women having been in much hunger they went and died.</p>

<p class="first">In a certain country an old man ground gunpowder.
Having ground it until the time when it became night, he dried it in
the sun. In the evening, at the time when he was preparing
(<i>lit.</i>, making) to put it in the powder-horn, the old
gentleman&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7421src" href="#xd27e7421"
name="xd27e7421src">2</a> grandson having come said,
&ldquo;Grandmother, let us burn (<i lang="si-latn">pussamu</i>)
gunpowder, to look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, having scolded the child she said, &ldquo;Bring a
fire-brand.&rdquo; Having brought it, &ldquo;Grandmother, give me a
little powder,&rdquo; he said. After that, she put gunpowder into a
potsherd. Having put it in she told him to burn it. When he was placing
the fire-brand [to it] the little powder that was in the potsherd all
burnt.</p>
<p>Because the old gentleman was near the potsherd the old
gentleman&rsquo;s beard and body were burnt. On account of the
difficulty of his body he said to his wife, &ldquo;Warm and give me a
little water,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The woman having warmed the water called him to bathe; at that time
the old gentleman came there. After that, while the woman for the
purpose of cooling the water went to bring cold water, the man, taking
a piece of coconut shell, poured [the hot water] over his body. Because
there was too much heat in the water his body began to burn.</p>
<p>While he was crying out on his body&rsquo;s burning, a man having
come said for that burning, &ldquo;Cowdung (<i lang=

<p>Afterwards the man having gone running, bringing excrement deposited
by a child called Goma, from the place where they tie the cattle,
smeared it on the burning places. The [old] man perceiving the stench,
at the time when he said to his wife, &ldquo;What is this stench? Is
this cowdung or what? Look,&rdquo; the woman brought a lamp. When she
looked, perceiving that it was ordure, she said, &ldquo;The things this
foolish stubborn fellow is doing to himself!&rdquo; Spitting, having
brought water and bathed him she went with him into the house.
Afterwards in many days she made him well.</p>

was heard, not a female elephant nor tusk elephant stays away; it comes
to look. In that manner he caused many elephants to be brought [up to
him] in the jungles.</p>
<p>A Princess of another city was minded to look at this Prince.
Because it was so she said, &ldquo;I will (would) give five hundred
masuran to a person who brought and gave him; having given them I will
marry that person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet [another] Prince asked, &ldquo;I will bring and give him; will
you marry me?&rdquo; When he asked, the Princess says, &ldquo;Cause him
to be brought; I will [then] marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon this Prince having also taken a great quantity of white
cloths, proceeded to that city. Having gone there, and having halted
(<i lang="si-latn">natara-wel&#257;</i>) in a jungle, cutting sticks he
constructed a white tusk elephant with [them and] the white cloths;
having made it this Prince is under the tusk elephant.</p>
<p>Certain men (<i lang="si-latn">minissu wagayak</i>) having seen this
white tusk elephant, say to the Prince who having played the Lute
causes the tusk elephant to be brought, &ldquo;O Prince, there is a
good white tusk elephant in that forest,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>Afterwards this Prince took the Lute and played it as on other days;
this tusk elephant did not come. Having said [to himself], &ldquo;What
is [the reason of] it, Bola? To-day <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb222" href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>this tusk elephant
did not come!&rdquo; and having gone a considerable distance he played
it. Then this tusk elephant went a little further off (<i lang=
"si-latn">epi&#7789;a&#7789;a</i>). The Prince at that time went near
and played it; then this elephant went still a little further. In that
manner this Prince having placed and placed the Lute at the end
(<i lang="si-latn">ass&#275;</i>) of the tusk elephant&rsquo;s tail,
plays it; still also this tusk elephant goes on. In that way these very
two went to this Princess&rsquo;s city.</p>
<p>Thereupon this Princess became much pleased, and having given five
hundred masuran to this Prince got married to this Prince. The Prince
who played the Lute she caused to remain as the Minister.</p>

<p class="first">At a certain time there was a man; the man had a girl
and a boy. At the time when they were thus, the man went alone to the
sea to catch fish (<i lang="si-latn">mas</i>). Having gone, when he was
catching fish a very large wave having knocked him into the sea, the
man on account of the water (current) drifted away.</p>
<p>At that time the men of the ferry-boat near there were laying nets.
This man having gone was entangled (<i>lit.</i>, tied) in the nets.
Then the ferry-boat men drew out the nets. When they looked a man was
entangled in a net. Then, taking the man ashore they laid him on his
face, and while they were pressing on his belly with the feet, without
the man&rsquo;s life going he breathed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7518src" href="#xd27e7518" name="xd27e7518src">1</a> Then without
having caused hurt to this man when they were treading on his belly for
the water to go, the man became conscious.</p>
<p>Then the men having said, &ldquo;Of what country are you?&rdquo;
having spread the news around, and given him cooked rice which had been
taken for the party to eat, they told him to choose [some] fishes. He
having selected them, in the evening they went to the village, taking
the man. Having gone [there], as this man who fell into the sea does
not know the road to go to his village, doing work for hire for the
ferry-boat men and continuing to eat [thus], he stayed [there].</p>
<p>The elder female child and the younger lad whom there were of the
man who fell into the sea, went to the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s
shop to bring salt. At the time when they went, the <span class=

house, and shut the door. Having beaten the boy, they drove him
away.</p>
<p>At that time, the King of that city having made ready a very great
eating (<i lang="si-latn">k&#257;ema</i>), sent letters to the Kings of
other cities to come for the eating. After that, those Kings all came
to the city. In the royal party, the King of the city at which was the
man who fell into the sea and went ashore, also came.</p>
<p>Having come, all the party having assembled in that day night, after
they ate the food this lad who had lost his father and elder sister had
come [there]. Having given food to this lad, while he was [there] the
royal party, having eaten and drunk, conversed together regarding the
happiness and sorrow in the various cities.</p>
<p>Then this lad who was without father and elder sister, thought of
telling the matters which the party omitted, by way of a verse. Having
thought of it he says,</p>

<p>When he was [there] in that way for a little time, the King of that

they walk through the whole city. Then the tusk elephant keeps coming
towards the palace itself.</p>
<p>Because of it, men came out on the path on which the tusk elephant
is coming. At that time, the tusk elephant having come, kneeling down
made obeisance to that lad.</p>
<p>Then those men, having made the lad bathe in sandal water (water
perfumed with sandal), and placed him on the tusk elephant&rsquo;s
back, went in procession round the city, and having come back they
burnt that King, and made a funeral mound [over the ashes].</p>
<p>While exercising the sovereignty over the men of the city, when a
little time had gone the King went to that place called the

and having beheaded all the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;s, came back
calling his elder sister [to accompany him], and gave her in
marriage.</p>
<p>There was a daughter of the dead King. After marrying that Princess,
in a little time there was a child.</p>
<p>After that, he went to that city in which his father is, and calling
his father also, he returned. Having come back, he remained exercising
the sovereignty in a good manner.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain village attached to a seaport there was a
poor man. The man tried to borrow twenty thousand pounds from rich men
who were in the village. As there was not a thing to take from him [as
security] any one was unwilling to give the money.</p>
<p>While he was walking about asking for the money, a certain
nobleman<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7730src" href="#xd27e7730" name=
"xd27e7730src">1</a> having called him, said, &ldquo;I will give you
the money; I shall not take it again from you.&rdquo; Having said thus,
he counted the money and gave it to him.</p>
<p>And the man taking it, and having gone near the landing-place and
expended two thousand pounds, caused a house to be built, and having
expended sixteen thousand pounds caused the house to be filled with
cow-dung, chaff, etc.</p>
<p>After that, he set fire to the house, and having collected and put
into sacks the whole of the ashes, he gave a thousand pounds, and
bringing a ship for hire loaded the sacks into it. Having gone to a
country in which cold, etc., proceed from serpents,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7738src" href="#xd27e7738" name="xd27e7738src">2</a> and
heaped up the sacks, and told him to come in three months more, he sent
away the shipmaster (<i lang="si-latn">naew-potiy&#257;</i>).</p>
<p>The man having unfastened the whole of the sacks of ashes, placed
[the ashes] thinly [on the ground]. The whole of the serpents having
come to the ashes, owing to their having slept there eject jewels.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>After three months he again put the ashes into the sacks. And the
ship having arrived that day, he loaded the whole of the sacks [in it],
and having gone to his own country and heaped up the sacks, and for the
remaining cash taking a house for hire, he placed the sacks of ashes
[in it], and dwelt there.</p>
<p>One day having washed a little of the ashes from a bag, there was a
quantity (<i lang="si-latn">r&#257;siyak</i>) of very valuable gems
there. Having shown that to the nobleman who gave the money, he told
him to take a part from the bags, but he said he did not want them. And
the poor man having much importuned him, and given him a portion from
the bags, the two persons lived in friendship.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Learned Poor Man</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country a poor man, having nothing to
eat, went to another country. Having gone there, and gone to a
travellers&rsquo; shed, he remained lying down.</p>
<p>During the time while he was there, still [another] man of the city
who was without food and clothing came to the travellers&rsquo; shed.
Then the man who came first asked the man who came afterwards,
&ldquo;Where art thou going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;Being without [food] to eat, I am going to this
city to beg something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man who came first says, &ldquo;I, indeed, being without
[food] to eat have come here. Now then, because we two are men without
[food] to eat, I will tell you a device,&rdquo; said the man who came
first to the man who came afterwards.</p>
<p>Then the man who came afterwards asked, &ldquo;What is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man says, &ldquo;Thou having gone to the royal palace and made
obeisance, say at the hand of the King, &lsquo;From the exalted royal
palace I ought to receive a salary.&rsquo; Then the King will ask,
&lsquo;On what account should I give pay to thee?&rsquo; Then say thou,
&lsquo;In this your kingdom, Sir, either for any needed fight, or any
needed thing, when I have come into the midst of it I can manage the
affair. I can [also] beat the notification tom-toms. Because of that,
indeed, I am asking pay.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man having gone near the royal palace, asked in that
manner. The King asked, &ldquo;For what shall I give pay to
thee?&rdquo; The man replied in the very way which that man told
him.</p>
<p>Then the King having heard the words and being pleased, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>appointed a salary for that man, and said,
&ldquo;From to-day thou must look after the troubles of this
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; said at the hand of
the King, &ldquo;I have nothing to eat,&rdquo; asking for the pay also,
[and he received a sum in advance].</p>
<p>Having gone near that man who gave him the instructions, and told
him this talk which occurred at the royal palace, and given the teacher
a half share from that pay which was given, taking the other half share
the man went to his village. That man who gave the instructions, not
going anywhere else, remained cooking and eating at that very
travellers&rsquo; shed.</p>
<p>Thereafter, for the man who received the pay the King established
the name B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7795src" href="#xd27e7795" name="xd27e7795src">1</a> Well then,
when that B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257; was coming and going to [and from]
the palace, he was providing assistance for that teacher.</p>
<p>At that time, on a road of the city a lion having lain in wait began
to kill people. In those days, B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257;, having come
to his village, stayed [there]. Without telling
B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257;, because he was a new man, having sent the
old accustomed Ministers and other multitudes for killing the lion,
[the King] told them to return [after] killing the lion.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the party having been sent to go, after they went, when
B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257; was going to the royal palace he went to the
place where the teacher was staying.</p>
<p>At that time, the news regarding this lion having reached the
teacher, he said, &ldquo;In this manner, a lion which eats men is
staying at this city. I have news that men went from the royal palace
to kill the lion. Because of it, as soon as you go, &lsquo;You must
seize the lion,&rsquo; the King will say. Thereupon, say &lsquo;I
can,&rsquo; and asking for a piece of cord, and placing it [coiled]
round your neck, go. Then the men will come [after] killing the lion.
Then say, &lsquo;There! People, the work you have done is good!
(sarcastically). Asking for a cord I came from the palace [in order] to
go [back after] seizing it [alive], so as to place it as a
present<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7813src" href="#xd27e7813" name=
"xd27e7813src">2</a> [for the King]. Concerning this, blame will fall
on you from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>the King.&rsquo; Having said this, frighten
them. Thereupon the party will say, &lsquo;An&#275;!
B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257;, don&rsquo;t say that we killed it.&rsquo;
Then say thou, &lsquo;It is good. If so, let no one speak [about it].
Having placed [the deed] upon my own back, I will say it myself.&rsquo;
Then the men will say, &lsquo;It is good.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257; was doing this, it happened in this
very manner. [The King] gave B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257; at the rate of
a thousand masuran a month. Then B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257;, taking the
pay, as on other days continued to give little by little [only] to that
teacher, so that his regard [for him] became lost, and remained so.</p>
<p>At that time, to seize that city seven Kings and seven armies came,
and surrounded the city. On account of it, this King having said,
&ldquo;To this M&#257;ra<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7827src" href=
"#xd27e7827" name="xd27e7827src">3</a> army what shall I do?&rdquo; was
in fear.</p>
<p>Then the King having waited until the time when
B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257; came, says, &ldquo;It is not like you killed
the lion. Seven Kings and seven armies having come, are near the city
gates. Go and fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257; went near that teacher, and told him
this. The teacher said, &ldquo;[After] asking for the King&rsquo;s
festival tusk elephant and sword, come thou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257; having gone near the King,
when he came [after] asking for the festival tusk elephant and the
sword, both of them went for the fight. Having gone,
B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257;, being on the tusk elephant, when he peeped
and looked having seen those monarchs<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7836src" href="#xd27e7836" name="xd27e7836src">4</a> and the
multitude, fell unconscious under the tusk elephant.</p>
<p>Thereupon, that teacher, having dragged B&#275;ri-N&#257;day&#257;
aside, and cast him away, wrote a letter and shot it [attached to an
arrow] to the place where those seven Kings were. The royal party said,
&ldquo;What is this that is fallen from the sky?&rdquo; When they
looked there was written, &ldquo;It is I myself whom they call
Danuddara Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#333;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7846src" href="#xd27e7846" name="xd27e7846src">5</a> If you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>can, be pleased to come to fight.&rdquo; The
royal party becoming afraid regarding it, all ran off to the quarters
to which each one went.</p>
<p>The Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#333; came to the palace on the tusk
elephant. After he came, the Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#333; was placed by
the King in the post of Prime Minister.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In <i>The J&#257;taka</i>, No. 80 (vol. i, p. 204)
there is a story which closely agrees with this. The clever man was a
dwarfish Br&#257;hma&#7751;a who, aware that he would not be employed
on account of his small size, joined with a huge ignorant weaver, who
received an appointment as archer to the King at Benares. By following
the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a&rsquo;s instructions the weaver obtained all
the credit of killing a tiger and buffalo as in this tale, but becoming
proud, he treated his adviser with scorn. Afterwards, when ordered to
attack a hostile force he was so overcome with fear that the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a made him descend from the elephant on which they
were riding, and he himself then attacked the enemy&rsquo;s camp,
captured the King, and was loaded with honours.</p>
<p>The despatch of the message attached to the arrow is not mentioned
in this story; but in the J&#257;taka tale No. 181 (vol. ii, p. 62)
Prince Asadisa, son of a King of Benares, is represented as scratching
a message on an arrow, firing it into the camp of some hostile forces
headed by seven Kings who were besieging the city, and thereby scaring
these enemies away. A footnote states that in the <i lang=
"sa-latn">Mah&#257;vastu</i> the message was wrapped round the
arrow.</p>
<p>In two instances in the <i lang="sa-latn">Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata</i>
(<i lang="sa-latn">Dr&#333;na Parva</i>, xcix, and cci) the
senders&rsquo; names were engraved on arrows.</p>
<p>In the <i>Arabian Nights</i> (Lady Burton&rsquo;s ed., vol. 4, p.
103), a Prince wrote a letter, set it on the point of an arrow, and
shot it into a garden in which a lady was walking.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. i, <span class="corr" id="xd27e7896" title=
"Not in source">p.</span> 519, a young Br&#257;hma&#7751;a suggested to
a Prince that he should receive a daily salary of one hundred gold
pieces; this was paid to him. In the same work, vol. ii, p. 251, an
unknown man demanded and received five hundred d&#299;n&#257;rs (about
&pound;250) as his daily wage. In the <i lang=
"sa-latn">Hit&#333;pad&#275;&#347;a</i> an unknown R&#257;jput was
granted four hundred gold pieces as his daily pay.</p>
<p>While the Sinhalese were besieging the Portuguese in Colombo in
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1588, the Sinhalese King shot into the
fort a letter containing a demand for the safe conduct of officials who
were to arrange a truce (Pieris, <i>Ceylon</i>, vol. i, p. 243).

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain city there were a poor woman and a man.
Because the two persons had not [anything] to eat and to wear, the
woman having pounded and pounded [paddy] obtained a livelihood.</p>
<p>When not much time had gone in this manner, being unable to pound
and eat, her strength and ability [to work] went. Thereupon she one day
having beaten the man with the broom,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7920src" href="#xd27e7920" name="xd27e7920src">1</a> and having
said, &ldquo;Strumpet&rsquo;s son, bring thou from somewhere or other
things for food,&rdquo; seized him by the hair-knot, and cast him out
of the door-way.</p>
<p>Then the man, through shame at what the woman had done, having gone
along a road and sat down at a tree, when the time for eating rice
came, wept.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; who stayed in that tree came
and asked at the hand of the man, &ldquo;Bola, what art thou crying
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this man says, &ldquo;O Lord, my wife having become without
strength or ability [to work], because we two were unable to obtain
[anything] having beaten me with the broom, seized me by the hair-knot
and put me outside. Having come [here] owing to it, because I cannot
bear my hunger I wept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; asked, &ldquo;What dost thou
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;I want goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257;, having given the man three
pills, says, &ldquo;Taking these three pills, having thought of the
thing thou wantest cast them down. The things thou wantest will be
created.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235"
name="pb235">235</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the man, taking the pills, for one said, &ldquo;May my house be
created a palace, together with the possession of wealth,&rdquo; and
threw away one pill. In that manner this occurred.</p>
<p>For the next one he said, &ldquo;On each side of the door-way of my
house, may a horse of silver and a tusk elephant of gold be
created,&rdquo; and threw away a pill. In that manner they were
created.</p>
<p>For the other one he said, &ldquo;A road to my house having been
created, let a carriage for me to go in, and many things come into
existence,&rdquo; and threw away the other pill. In that very way they
were created. After that, having come home he remained in
happiness.</p>
<p>After that, a woman of another house came to this house for fire.
Having come and seen these matters, she asked this woman,
&ldquo;Sister-in-law, how did you obtain these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon this woman says, &ldquo;Having beaten my husband with the
broom, I caught him by the hair-knot, and put him out at the door-way,
to seek goods and come back. After that, he went, and having been near
a tree came back [after] receiving them.&rdquo; Having said [this], she
told the woman about these matters [and that her husband received the
things he thought of].</p>
<p>Afterwards the woman, having gone home and beaten the woman&rsquo;s
husband with the broom, caught him by the hair-knot, and put him out at
the door-way. The man having gone also, stayed near the tree, weeping
and weeping.</p>
<p>At that time, by the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; three pills were given
(<i>lit.</i>, gave) to [this] man also. The man, taking them, came
home.</p>
<p>Thereupon the woman having warmed water, and made him bathe, and
given him to eat, and given him betel to eat, asked the man,
&ldquo;What have you brought?&rdquo; The man showed her the three
pills.</p>
<p>The woman, taking the three pills in her hand, and having looked at
them, said, &ldquo;Are these <i lang="si-latn">ani</i> that you have
brought?&rdquo; and threw them away. Then in every place on the
woman&rsquo;s body <i lang="si-latn">ani</i> were created. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then for three years having striven, finding the three pills she
said, &ldquo;Leaving the <i lang="si-latn">anus</i> which was there,
may the others be obliterated,&rdquo; and having picked up the three
pills she threw them away. Thereupon she became as at first.</p>

<p class="first">The plight of the woman is nearly similar to that of
Indra after he had been cursed by Gautama for visiting Ahaly&#257;, as
related in the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i>, vol.
i, p. 123.</p>
<p>In <i>Folklore in Southern India</i> (Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a
S&#257;str&#299;), p. 208, while an indigent Br&#257;hma&#7751;a was
asleep in a forest, the God &#346;iva and his wife P&#257;rvat&#299;
ate his cooked rice, leaving in its place five magic cups of gold out
of each of which an Apsaras came and served him with delicious food.
After he had returned home and given a feast to the villagers, a rich
landholder went off to obtain similar prizes, the God and Goddess ate
his rice, and left five cups for him. As soon as he returned home he
summoned the whole village to a feast; but when the cups were opened
out several barbers issued from each, and held and shaved all the
guests clean.</p>
<p>In the <i>Arabian Nights</i> (Lady Burton&rsquo;s ed., vol. iv, p.
114) a man heard in the Night of Power that three prayers would be
granted to him. After consulting his wife, he prayed that his nose
might be magnified, as a sign of his nobility, and it became so large
that he could not move. He then prayed to be rid of it, and his nose
disappeared altogether; his last prayer caused it to be restored to its
first state. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=

<p class="first">In a certain country there are a King and a Queen, it
is said. The Queen bore a Princess. In that very country there are a
R&#257;kshasa and a R&#257;kshas&#299;. The R&#257;kshas&#299;, too,
bore a son. In that Princess&rsquo;s horoscope there was [found] that
she will contract marriage with a R&#257;kshasa; in that
R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s horoscope there was [found] that he will marry a
Princess.</p>
<p>After both had become considerably big the King and Queen died; only
that Princess is in the palace.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa can create anything [he has] thought of. The
R&#257;kshasa thought, &ldquo;The palace and royal goods that are in
the palace all are to disappear.&rdquo; In that very manner they
disappeared.</p>
<p>There not being a place for the Princess to stay in, when she is
weeping and weeping the R&#257;kshasa having come there asked at the
hand of the Princess, &ldquo;What are you weeping for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princess said, &ldquo;I weep as there is not a place for me
to be in, and not a thing to eat,&mdash;because of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that the R&#257;kshasa said, &ldquo;I will give food and
clothing; can you come to our house?&rdquo; Then the Princess said,
&ldquo;I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the R&#257;kshasa and the Princess came to the
R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s house. Then at the hand of the R&#257;kshasa
asked the R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s mother, &ldquo;Who, son, is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said, &ldquo;Mother, I have come summoning such and such a
King&rsquo;s Princess, for you to get [some] ease.&rdquo;<a class=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>After that, the R&#257;kshas&#299; having said, &ldquo;Yes, it is
good,&rdquo; while, having employed the Princess, she was making her do
all the work, the Princess being like a servant of the
R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s, the R&#257;kshas&#299; had the thought,
&ldquo;[How] if I eat the Princess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thought it, one day when the R&#257;kshas&#299; was preparing
to go to eat human bodies she said at the hand of the Princess,
&ldquo;[By the time] when I am coming, having brought and placed
[ready] seven large pots of water, and brought and placed [ready] seven
bundles of firewood, and boiled and pounded seven p&#257;elas of paddy
(each about three-eighths of a bushel), and plastered cow-dung on [the
floors of] seven houses, and cooked, warm water for me to bathe and
place thou it [ready]. If not, I will eat thee.&rdquo; Having said this
the R&#257;kshas&#299; went to eat human bodies.</p>
<p>After that, the Princess remained weeping and weeping. So the
R&#257;kshasa asked, &ldquo;What art thou crying for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;Mother, telling me so many works, went
away. How shall I do them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshasa said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thou be doubtful
about it. When mother, having come back, has asked, say thou that thou
didst all the works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Princess, having remained silent in the very manner
the R&#257;kshasa said, told at the hand of the R&#257;kshas&#299; [on
her return] that she did the works. When the R&#257;kshas&#299; looked
to see if the works were right, all were right. Well then, to eat the
Princess there was no means for the R&#257;kshas&#299;.</p>
<p>After that, she sent word to the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s younger
sister, &ldquo;There is a girl of the palace [here]; I have no means of
eating that girl; whatever work I told her that work has been quite
rightly done. Now then, how shall I eat [her]? I will send this girl
near you; then you eat her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshas&#299; said at the hand of the Princess, &ldquo;Go
to the house of our younger sister&rsquo;s people; a box of mine is
there. If thou dost not bring it I will eat thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Princess having come near the stile, while she was
weeping and weeping the R&#257;kshasa came there and asked, &ldquo;What
art thou weeping for?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href=
"#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Princess said, &ldquo;Mother told me that there is a box at
the house of little-mother&rsquo;s people.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8041src" href="#xd27e8041" name="xd27e8041src">3</a> Having said
[I am] to bring it, if not she will eat me, when I have gone for the
box little-mother will eat me. To-day indeed I cannot
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the R&#257;kshasa [said], &ldquo;Little-mother is
blowing and blowing [the fire] at the hearth; the box is near the door.
Thou having gone running, taking the box come away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, having gone running, at the time when the Princess
looked the R&#257;kshas&#299; is blowing and blowing at the hearth; the
box was near the door. The Princess having gone into the house, taking
the box came running. The R&#257;kshas&#299; chased after her; she was
unable to eat her. For that R&#257;kshas&#299; [who sent her] there,
also there was not a way to eat her.</p>
<p>When she was there in that way for a considerable time they asked
for a marriage for the R&#257;kshasa. Having asked it, the
R&#257;kshas&#299; also having become ready to go for the marriage,
said at the hand of the Princess, &ldquo;When we come summoning the
bride, having well prepared the house, and set the tables and chairs,
and boiled and cooked for the marriage party, place [the food
ready].&rdquo; Saying [this] the R&#257;kshas&#299; went for the
marriage.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa having been behind said at the hand of the
Princess, &ldquo;Thou having remained without speaking, say thou didst
all the works that mother told thee.&rdquo; Having said it the
R&#257;kshasa, too, went for the marriage.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Princess having been [there] without speaking, after
the wedding-party, summoning the bride, returned, the
R&#257;kshas&#299; asked at the hand of the Princess, &ldquo;Didst thou
do all the works I told thee? Didst thou do them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; When the R&#257;kshas&#299;
looked all the works were right; there also there was no way to eat
her.</p>
<p>Afterwards she taught the bride, &ldquo;Daughter, there!
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>Eat that girl if you can; I tried to eat her in
[every] possible manner.&rdquo; After that, the girl tried if she could
eat her;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8069src" href="#xd27e8069" name=
"xd27e8069src">4</a> she was unable to eat the Princess.</p>
<p>When she was there in that manner a considerable time, the
R&#257;kshasa and the Princess having got hid went away. Having thus
gone, and having created the Princess&rsquo;s royal palace in the very
manner in which it was [before], the two remained at the palace.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain city there is a R&#257;kshas&#299;, it is
said. The R&#257;kshas&#299; seizing each man who is going along, eats
him. While a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a was going along, she seized the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, but because the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a had a good
beautiful figure, putting him in her rock-house (cave) and shutting the
door, she remained without eating him.</p>
<p>During the time while he was there a child was borne to the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a by the R&#257;kshas&#299;; the child was like the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a. Having sought food she continued to give it to the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a and the little one. While the R&#257;kshas&#299;
was there in that way the youngster (<i lang=
"si-latn">pae&#7789;iy&#257;</i>) became big.</p>
<p>One day having waited until the time when the R&#257;kshas&#299;
goes to seek food, the youngster asked at the hand of the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, &ldquo;Father, what is [the reason why] you have
one form and mother a [different] form?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a says, &ldquo;Son, your mother is a
R&#257;kshas&#299;. Seizing each man who is going past this place, she
eats him. I also came to go this way. Then seizing me she put me in the
rock cave. She has not done any harm to me yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youngster said, &ldquo;Father, we cannot remain in this way.
R&#257;kshas&#299;s and men cannot be in one place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshas&#299; came, bringing food. So the youngster
said, &ldquo;Mother, when you are not here how will it be for us? Tell
us the limits [of the power] of these persons&rdquo; (that is, those
who lived there).</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshas&#299; said, &ldquo;In width they are five gawwas
(twenty miles); in length they are ten gawwas (forty miles).&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following day, during the time when the R&#257;kshas&#299;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>went to seek food, the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a and
the youngster having taken a large quantity of excellent (<i lang=
"si-latn">hon&#774;da hon&#774;da</i>) goods, the two persons bounded
off to go by the quarter that was ten gawwas long, and went away. Then
the R&#257;kshas&#299; having come [after] seeking food, when she
looked neither Br&#257;hma&#7751;a nor youngster [was there].</p>
<p>After that, while the R&#257;kshas&#299; was going along continuing
to cry aloud, these two persons had not yet succeeded in bounding
through the forest that was ten gawwas in length. The
R&#257;kshas&#299;, weeping and weeping, having said, &ldquo;What was
this need for you to abandon me?&rdquo; came back, summoning these two
[to accompany her].</p>
<p>On the following day, after the R&#257;kshas&#299; went to seek
food, these two persons having bounded through the quarter that was
five gawwas in width, reached the far bank of a river.</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshas&#299; having come [after] seeking food, when
she looked these two were not [there]. After that, as the
R&#257;kshas&#299; was coming continuing to cry aloud, these two came
to this bank of the river; the R&#257;kshas&#299;, sitting down on the
bank on that [other] side, remained crying aloud.</p>
<p>While she was there the R&#257;kshas&#299; said, &ldquo;Son, there
is a spell of mine; [after] learning it go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the youngster said, &ldquo;I will not [return to learn
it]; say it while sitting there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the R&#257;kshas&#299;, sitting on the bank on that side,
said the spell. The youngster, sitting on the bank on this side, learnt
the spell. &ldquo;When you have uttered that spell, on this side of
twelve years you will meet with any lost thing,&rdquo; the
R&#257;kshas&#299; said.</p>
<p>After that, the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a and the youngster came away to
the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a&rsquo;s village. That R&#257;kshas&#299; having
been looking while a trace of the heads of these two was visible,
through the affection there was for the two persons, when those two
were hidden [from her view] the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s bosom was
rent, and she died.</p>
<p>While that Br&#257;hma&#7751;a and the youngster, having gone to the
village, were staying there, certain goods of the King&rsquo;s having
been lost, the King published a proclamation by beat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>of
tom-toms that to a person who found and gave the goods he will give
wealth [amounting] to a tusk elephant&rsquo;s load, and a district from
the kingdom.</p>
<p>Then the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a&rsquo;s youngster having said, &ldquo;I
can,&rdquo; and having uttered the spell taught by that
R&#257;kshas&#299;, obtained the goods and gave them to the King. He
having given them, the King gave to the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a&rsquo;s
youngster wealth [amounting] to a tusk elephant&rsquo;s load, and a
district from the kingdom.</p>

432 (vol. iii, p. 298), in which the King and family priest hid some
valuable jewels taken by them out of the treasury, in order to test a
youngster&rsquo;s power. He discovered them, but the King insisted on
his declaring also who was the thief. He endeavoured to avoid doing
this, and when at last he made it known, the people rose, killed the
King and priest, and set the youngster (who was the B&#333;dhisatta) on
the throne.</p>

<h2 class="main">How a R&#257;kshasa Turned Men and Bulls into
Stone</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are seven elder brothers
and younger brothers. In a certain [other] country there are seven
elder sisters and younger sisters. At the time when they are there the
whole of the seven elder brothers and younger brothers are without
wives; the seven elder sisters and younger sisters are without men
(husbands).</p>
<p>At the time when the seven elder brothers and younger brothers are
doing work in the rice field, the seven elder sisters and younger
sisters are going by the place where they are working. &ldquo;Where are
you going?&rdquo; they asked (<i lang="si-latn">haehuww&#257;</i>).</p>
<p>At the time when they asked they said, &ldquo;Seven elder sisters
and younger sisters are going to seek for themselves seven elder
brothers and younger brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We indeed are seven elder brothers and younger
brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the eldest elder brother the eldest elder sister contracted
(<i>lit.</i>, tied) marriage; with those [other] six persons these six
[other] persons contracted marriage. To the seven houses they took the
seven persons (their wives).</p>
<p>A R&#257;kshasa came for religious donations (<i lang=
"si-latn">sam&#257;dam&#275;</i>). Having come, at the very first he
got donations from the eldest elder sister. When he begged from the
other six, five persons gave donations abundantly (<i lang=
"si-latn">hon&#774;da&#7789;ama</i>). When he begged for donations from
the youngest younger sister, she tried to give them [while] sitting in
the house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not take them in that way,&rdquo; [he said].</p>
<p>When, having come to the doorway, she tried to give them [there, the
R&#257;kshasa] placed a walking-stick in his hand, and when he extended
[it towards her] he began to go in front; the woman, weeping and
weeping, began to go behind the R&#257;kshasa [holding the other end of
the magic stick].</p>
<p>Having gone on and on, at the time when he stopped there were seven
stone posts. When the walking-stick that was in his hand prodded the
ground she became stone [like them].</p>
<p>The young younger sister&rsquo;s seven elder brothers and younger
brothers went [on a trading journey?] taking seven yokes of bulls. At
the time when they were taking them, the seven yokes of bulls and the
seven men he made into stone.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8199src" href=
"#xd27e8199" name="xd27e8199src">1</a></p>
<p>He restored that woman to consciousness again; having restored her
to consciousness the R&#257;kshasa went with her [to his] home. After
he went, when the son of the elder sister of the younger sister who
went with [the R&#257;kshasa] proceeded there (<i lang=

narrator was unacquainted with the rest of it.)</p>

<p class="first">In <i>Folklore of the Santal Parganas</i> (Rev. Dr.
Bodding), p. 222, a J&#333;g&#299; turned into stone seven brothers who
had followed him in order to recover the wife of one of them whom he
had carried off by getting her arm-tassel and going away with it. She
was compelled to follow him while it was in his possession. When her
son who was left behind proceeded in search of her, he came to the
place where his petrified uncles were. As he was eating his food there
he saw the stones weeping, recognised them, and placed a little food on
each for them to eat. Afterwards, when he had killed the J&#333;g&#299;
and was returning with his mother, he bathed, and then spread a cloth
over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>the stones, on which they recovered their human
shape, became alive, and thought they had merely slept.</p>
<p>In the <i>Story of Madana K&#257;ma R&#257;ja</i>
(Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;), p. 85, a Prince who had
stolen the garments of Indra&rsquo;s daughter while she was bathing,
was turned by her spells into stone when he looked back at her. He was
revived by an old woman with whom he lived; she sprinkled water on the
stone and uttered spells.</p>
<p>In the same work, p. 149, the Turtle Prince was informed that if he
looked back after stealing the garments of a divine maid or Apsaras
while she was bathing, he would be turned into stone. See the first
note after No. 151 in this volume.</p>

<p class="first">In a certain country there is an islet; on the islet
there are a few houses. On the islet a R&#257;kshasa dwells. This
R&#257;kshasa having seized them eats [the men] from each house at the
rate of one man every day.</p>
<p>When the R&#257;kshasa is coming seizing and eating the men in that
way for a great number of years, the men of the islet having become
finished, at one house, only, men have remained over. In that family
there are two parents and four children. The names of the four are
One-cubit, Two-cubits, Three-cubits, Four-cubits.</p>
<p>While these children are there, the R&#257;kshasa seized even both
the parents of these children. Out of the children, the child called
Four-cubits is a female child. The female child for grief at the loss
of her mother is weeping and weeping. While these three elder brothers
are unable to pacify her, one day at night, One-cubit having spoken
says, &ldquo;Two-cubits, Three-cubits, being now without our mother and
father, there is not a thing for us to eat. Our younger sister having
remembered mother at all times, is weeping and weeping. Because of it,
I and Two-cubits having gone to a country, will come back [after]
seeking something for you to eat. Three-cubits, you stay [at home],
looking after and soothing younger sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One-cubit and Two-cubits having crossed over from the island, and
having gone on and on, arrived at a country. Having arrived, while they
are going thus, they met with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248"
href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>a youth who is looking after
cattle. Having met with him, he asked these two, &ldquo;Where are you
two going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We two are going seeking any sort of livelihood,&rdquo; they
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you two stay to look after cattle?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;We can,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;Come. Our Gamar&#257;la has many cattle. For
looking after them he still wants people,&rdquo; this youth who looks
after cattle, calling these two, went to the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>When they went, the Gamar&#257;la asked this youth who looks after
the cattle, &ldquo;Who are these two youths?&rdquo; &ldquo;These two
came seeking a livelihood,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la asks these youths, &ldquo;What can ye do for
a living?&rdquo; &ldquo;We can graze cattle,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la asked the big youth, &ldquo;What name?&rdquo;
&ldquo;One-cubit,&rdquo; he said. He asked the younger youth,
&ldquo;What is thy name?&rdquo; &ldquo;Two-cubits,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Gamar&#257;la, having given charge of one hundred
cattle to One-cubit, and one hundred cattle to Two-cubits, said,
&ldquo;Having thoroughly caused the cattle given to you to eat and
drink, and having looked after them, not giving the cattle to jungle
quadrupeds, ye must bring them in the evening, and completely put them
in the folds,&rdquo; the Gamar&#257;la said.</p>
<p>After many days, the Gamar&#257;la thought, &ldquo;I must go to look
at the cattle [that are] with One-cubit and Two-cubits.&rdquo; One day
in the evening, at the time when they were putting them in the folds,
he went and remained looking on. The cattle are thoroughly healthy.
When the Gamar&#257;la looked [at the numbers] those of both persons
are correct.</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la, having become much pleased, having gone home,
says, &ldquo;The cattle of One-cubit and Two-cubits are in very good
[condition]. Please give food amply to both youths,&rdquo; the
Gamar&#257;la ordered at the house. Thereupon, they give food amply to
both persons. For [many] days besides, the two are thoroughly taking
care of the cattle.</p>
<p>While Three-cubits is looking after the younger sister, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>one
day the younger sister, having called to remembrance her mother, began
to weep. Thereupon he said, &ldquo;Four-cubits, younger sister,
don&rsquo;t cry. Our big elder brother and little elder brother [after]
seeking food for us two will now bring it. Then I will give you a great
deal to eat.&rdquo; While he was speaking in order to pacify her, she
began to weep still still more. Three-cubits endeavoured much to pacify
her; he was unable to pacify her.</p>
<p>Then Three-cubits says, &ldquo;Younger sister, don&rsquo;t you cry;
I will go on the island, and bring a Kirala<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8295src" href="#xd27e8295" name="xd27e8295src">2</a> fruit, and
give you it. You remain [here] without going to bathe, or going
anywhere. I will go quickly, and bring Kirala.&rdquo; Having said
[this], Three-cubits went to the edge of the island.</p>
<p>Just as he is going there, the R&#257;kshasa having landed on the
island to seize and eat human bodies, when he is coming looking and
looking at the whole of the houses, he saw this Four-cubits, the little
lass,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8300src" href="#xd27e8300" name=
"xd27e8300src">3</a> and having sprung into the house, lifted her up
and ran away.</p>
<p>On the other bank of the island, sitting in a boat a man is killing
fish. Then, having seen this R&#257;kshasa lifting up this child and
going away, the man who is killing fish, having become afraid of the
R&#257;kshasa, sprang from the boat into the water, and remained under
water (<i>lit.</i>, swallowed up). After the R&#257;kshasa, not seeing
him, went away, the man who is killing fish mounted into the boat.</p>
<p>Well then, Three-cubits, [after] plucking Kirala quickly having gone
taking them to give to his younger sister, when he looked his younger
sister was not [there]. Thereupon, when Three-cubits, saying and
saying, &ldquo;Four cubits! Younger sister, younger sister!&rdquo; was
going weeping and weeping, seeking her, through not seeing her he
sought and sought still still further, and went to the edge of the
island.</p>
<p>While he was there weeping and weeping, saying and saying,
&ldquo;Four-cubits! Younger sister!&rdquo; that man who was rowing the
boat heard it, and came to see what this youth is lamenting for.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having come, &ldquo;What is it, boy, thou art lamenting for?&rdquo;
the boatman asked.</p>
<p>Then he says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Our younger sister was weeping and
weeping at home. Then, having come on the island to pluck a Kirala
fruit, I went back [after] plucking a Kirala fruit, to give it to
younger sister. Having gone home, when I looked for younger sister,
younger sister was not [there],&rdquo; the youth, weeping and weeping,
said to the boatman, saying and saying [also], &ldquo;When elder
brothers have come now, and have asked, &lsquo;Where is younger
sister?&rsquo; what shall I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the boatman says, &ldquo;Thou having now wept, what [good] will
it do? Why didst thou come away, leaving thy younger sister quite
alone? It would be thy younger sister whom, a little time before now,
when I was fishing and fishing sitting in the boat, I saw the
R&#257;kshasa carrying, and going away with, after crossing to the
other shore. I also sank in the water through fear, and got
hid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this youth, Three-cubits, saying and saying, &ldquo;Ayiy&#333;!
My younger sister! My younger sister!&rdquo; and again having wept and
wept, rolling on the ground, the boatman says to him, &ldquo;Thou
having now lamented, what [good] will it do? Be off home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, while Three-cubits is at home, weeping and weeping,
One-cubit having said, &ldquo;Two-cubits! Younger brother,&rdquo; says
[also], &ldquo;Now then, it is enough. We have stayed here. We
don&rsquo;t know now what our Three-cubits and Four-cubits our younger
sister are doing at this time. Let us go to look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One-cubit and Two-cubits spoke together, and said, &ldquo;Let us
tell the Gamar&#257;la to-day, and to-morrow go to the village, and
return. To go to look at either little younger brother or younger
sister is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One-cubit and Two-cubits, the cattle having gone [home] in the
evening, put them in the folds; and having gone to the house told the
Gamar&#257;la, &ldquo;We must go to our village, and [after] looking at
our younger brother and younger sister, come back,&rdquo; they said to
the Gamar&#257;la.</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;It is good. Go and come back
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>again.&rdquo; When he said, &ldquo;What do ye
want to take?&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;Should you tie up and give us a
few cakes to take to the village, it would be good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gama-g&#257;eni (wife of the Gamar&#257;la) quickly having
tied up two packets of cakes in sufficient quantity for both of them,
gave them to them to take. Both of them, taking them, set off to go to
the village, and went away.</p>
<p>Having gone, and crossed over to that shore, when they went home
only Three-cubits, their younger brother, was at home. &ldquo;Where,
little younger brother, is younger sister?&rdquo; asked One-cubit and
Two-cubits.</p>
<p>Then Three-cubits said, &ldquo;Elder brothers, after you went
younger sister began to cry. Then I said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cry; I
will go on the island and pluck a Kirala fruit, and bring it.&rsquo;
Having gone, when coming [after] plucking a Kirala fruit, a man who was
in the boat at the island saw that the R&#257;kshasa went away taking
younger sister,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then both the elder brothers asked, &ldquo;Where did he bring
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To that side of the island she was brought,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The whole three having been [there] a few days, the three spoke
together: &ldquo;Let us go to seek our younger sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; while the whole three are
going along eating and eating the two packets of cakes that they
brought, the two elder ones, having seen that the two packets of cakes
are coming to be finished, said to the younger brother, &ldquo;Our
cakes are coming to be finished. You go along this path, and return
[after] seeking something for us to eat,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>Three-cubits went; he went to seek some food, and return. When
going, he went to the house of the Ku&#7693;u
He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8354src" href=
"#xd27e8354" name="xd27e8354src">4</a> of that village. Having gone he
said, &ldquo;An&#275;! He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;lah&#257;mi, the food we
brought became finished. You must give something for us to eat for the
present on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said it, there was much paddy dust at the house of the
He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la&rsquo;s people. The
He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la told them to give <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>a
little of it. Then he made a large bag (<i lang=
"si-latn">olaguwak</i>), and putting in it paddy powder to the extent
it holds, when he was coming he saw (<i lang=
"si-latn">di&#7789;uw&#257;ya</i>) a large tree in the midst of the
jungle. When coming near the tree he saw a bats&rsquo; place. When he
looked there, having seen that many bats&rsquo; skins had fallen down,
those also in a sufficient quantity he put into the bag.</p>
<p>When he was coming [after] putting them in, he saw that both
One-cubit and Two-cubits, being without food, were sitting at the root
of a tree. When he asked, &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Until you came we were looking out at the road,&rdquo; they
said.</p>
<p>When they asked, &ldquo;What is there for us to eat?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Only paddy dust and bats&rsquo; skins,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do? Let us go, eating and eating even
those,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>When they were going very far in that manner, having seen that a man
is bringing an ass to sell, said Three-cubits, &ldquo;One-cubit,
Two-cubits, you must take that ass and give it to me,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;if not, I will not come to look for younger sister,&rdquo; he
said. Then, taking the ass they gave him it.</p>
<p>When going still further having seen that a man is bringing two flat
winnowing trays, &ldquo;One-cubit, Two-cubits, having taken those two
winnowing trays, you must give them to me,&rdquo; he said. Taking also
the two winnowing trays they gave him them.</p>
<p>When going still a little further, having seen that they are
bringing two bundles of creepers, he told them to take them also, and
give him them. Taking them also, when going on having seen that yet
[another] man was bringing a tom-tom, he told them to take that also,
and give him it. Taking that also, they gave him it.</p>
<p>Having seen that still a man was bringing two elephant&rsquo;s
tusks, he told them to take them also, and give him them. Taking them
also they gave him them.</p>
<p>When going still a little further, having seen that a man was taking
porcupine quills, he told them to ask for and give him a few of those
also. They asked for and gave them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<p>When going still a little further, having seen that there were two
red ants&rsquo; nests in a tree, &ldquo;Please break and give these
also to me,&rdquo; he said. Those also they broke off and gave.</p>
<p>When they gave them, having made two wallets, and put the things in
the two wallets, tying them well and loading all on the back of the
ass, as they were going very far they met with an old mother. Having
met with her she asked, &ldquo;An&#275;! where are you going on this
path? This path is a path going to the house of the R&#257;kshasa.
Should you go [on it] the R&#257;kshasa will kill and eat you,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>Then they say, &ldquo;It is on this path itself that our younger
sister will be. Let us go on. If the R&#257;kshasa kill us let him
kill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said [this], the three persons having gone on and on, when
they were going met with a great big house. The three spoke together:
&ldquo;It has now become night. Having stayed at a resting-place at
this house, let us go on in the morning to-morrow,&rdquo; they
said.</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; when they went near the house
the R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s wife asked, &ldquo;Who are you? Where are you
going? What came you here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are One-cubit, Two-cubits, Three-cubits. Our younger
sister, Four-cubits, having been in the island, a R&#257;kshasa brought
her away. We are going seeking her,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&#275;! My elder brothers, (<i lang=
"si-latn">ayiyan&#7693;il&#257;</i>)! Did you come seeking me?&rdquo;
Having said, &ldquo;It is I myself,&rdquo; holding her elder brothers
she smelt<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8405src" href="#xd27e8405" name=
"xd27e8405src">5</a> them, and said, &ldquo;Apoyi! When the
R&#257;kshasa has come now he will eat you.&rdquo; Having quickly
called them into the house, she told the whole of them (<i lang=
"si-latn">s&#275;raman&#7789;a</i>) to ascend to the upper room
(<i lang="si-latn">u&#7693;a ge&#7789;a</i>), and remain [there]. Even
the ass they took up. &ldquo;When the R&#257;kshasa has gone in the
morning we can talk together,&rdquo; she said. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having said [this], the younger sister, having gone outside, and
made fast and tied up the stile, and come back quickly, and given her
elder brothers to eat, became as though not knowing anything [about
them].</p>
<p>While she was there, when the R&#257;kshasa is coming saying
&ldquo;H&#363;&rdquo; three times, the three elder brothers were
frightened. The ass was more frightened than that; it began to move
about.</p>
<p>Then the younger sister says, &ldquo;Elder brother, there! The
R&#257;kshasa is coming! Remain without moving about until it becomes
light to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good, younger sister,&rdquo; Three-cubits, the youngest
elder brother, said.</p>
<p>There! When that little time was going the R&#257;kshasa came.
Washing his face and mouth, he sat down to eat food. Having sat down,
eating and eating food, he says, &ldquo;There is a smell of human
flesh; there is a smell of human flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshas&#299; says, &ldquo;If you eat human flesh, and
in your mouth there is human flesh, and in your hand there is human
flesh, is there not a smell of human flesh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is a smell of fresh human flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the R&#257;kshas&#299; said, &ldquo;If so, it is to eat me you
say that,&rdquo; the R&#257;kshasa, having eaten without speaking,
rolled over at that very place and went to sleep.</p>
<p>All One-cubit&rsquo;s party (<i lang="si-latn">Ekriyanal&#257;</i>),
through the fatigue of the journey, the whole of them (<i lang=
"si-latn">s&#275;raman&#7789;ama</i>) went fast asleep. When a little
time is going by, a red ant (<i lang="si-latn">dimiy&#257;</i>) having
come out of a red ants&rsquo; nest, and as it was going along having
climbed up the ass&rsquo;s leg, the red ant bit it. Then the ass,
making a sound &ldquo;Tok, tok,&rdquo; began to kick the boards [of the
floor].</p>
<p>Then One-cubit opened his eyes. When he was looking what was the
noise, it was the noise of the ass kicking. Then One-cubit held the
legs of the ass, for it not to make the noise.</p>
<p>Then the ass, becoming afraid, got up, making a sound,
&ldquo;Di&#7693;i-bi&#7693;i.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa having become afraid, and having jumped
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>up, when he was saying, &ldquo;What, Bola, is
this one? I am going to eat this one,&rdquo; Three-cubits says,
&ldquo;Come here, thou! To eat thee is insufficient for me!&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshasa, having been frightened, said, &ldquo;Who art
thou, Clever One, to eat me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the R&#257;kshasa<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8456src"
href="#xd27e8456" name="xd27e8456src">6</a>-eating
Pr&#257;kshasa,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa, becoming thoroughly frightened, called out,
&ldquo;Get down, and come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou come here,&rdquo; Three-cubits called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; he asked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I indeed, the R&#257;kshasa-eating
Pr&#257;kshasa,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, throw down thy two Jak trees,&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e8471src" href="#xd27e8471" name="xd27e8471src">7</a> he said.
Then he lifted up and threw down the two bundles of creepers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw down thy two tusks,&rdquo; he said. He lifted up and
threw down the two [elephant&rsquo;s] tusks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw down thy two ears,&rdquo; he said. He lifted up and
threw down the two winnowing trays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me one eye,&rdquo; he said. Then having put down the
tom-tom at the corner of a plank on which there was plaster he showed
him it.</p>
<p>He told him to tap on his belly, and show him it. Then, pressing one
hand on one side (end) of the tom-tom, at the other side (end) he made
a noise, &ldquo;B&#257;h&#257;k, b&#257;h&#257;k.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshasa having become [more] frightened, standing up
holding the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s hand, and looking for the road
so as to run off, told him to cry out.</p>
<p>Then Three-cubits thinks, &ldquo;When he is running away now, he
will run off taking with him younger sister.&rdquo; Having become
afraid of it, taking a red ants&rsquo; nest softly to the end of the
boards, he broke and threw down the red ants&rsquo; nest on the
R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s head. Then the R&#257;kshasa having let go the
hand of the R&#257;kshas&#299;, began to scratch his head and body in
all places.</p>
<p>At that very time having put the other red ants&rsquo; nest into the
two ears of the ass, the three persons began to prick it with the
porcupine quills. Then when it began to give hundreds of brays
(<i lang="si-latn">b&#363;ruw&#275; beri</i>), the R&#257;kshasa having
become thoroughly frightened, said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>below&rdquo;; and having abandoned even the
R&#257;kshas&#299;, crying &ldquo;H&#363;,&rdquo; and breaking through
the fence also and upsetting the village, on account of the noise of
the ass and the cunning of the three persons and the power of the red
ants, he ran away.</p>
<p>Then the elder brother, and the younger brothers, the three persons,
taking their younger sister, went to their village.</p>
<p class="storyLocation"><i>Kumbukkan, Eastern Province.</i></p>
<div id="s137a" class="div2 section storyNotes"><span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a variant (<i>a</i>) of the North-western Province
the persons were a youth termed One-span (Ek-wiyat&#257;), his two
elder brothers, and his elder and younger sisters. A quarrel having
arisen among them, One-span and his younger sister went off alone.
While they were in the midst of a forest a R&#257;kshas&#299; carried
off the girl during her brother&rsquo;s temporary absence, so he
returned home, informed the others, and he and his two brothers set off
in search of her. The elder sister having been angry with him, gave
One-span some cold boiled rice to take with him, and to the others warm
rice. When the two opened their bag of warm rice they heard worms or
grubs (<i lang="si-latn">panuw&#333;</i>) that were in it making a
sound, &ldquo;Mini, mini,&rdquo; as they gnawed at it, so they begged
their brother to share his cold rice with them. He did so, and
afterwards when they objected to take and carry along with them a
coconut tree, a palmira tree, an elephant calf (<i lang=
"si-latn">aet-wassek</i>), and two or three large black ants (<i lang=
"si-latn">ka&#7693;iy&#333;</i>), on each occasion he demanded the
return of the rice and curry they had eaten. They found their younger
sister at &ldquo;a very large tiled house,&rdquo; and she hid them and
the young elephant and the other things in the loft. The
R&#257;kshas&#299; returned, said, &ldquo;There is a smell of fresh
human flesh,&rdquo; and afterwards was frightened as in the story given
above, and ran away.</p>
<p>If the names in this tale and variant indicate the heights of the
persons, as appears probable, this is the only instance in which dwarfs
are mentioned in the Sinhalese folk-tales that I have collected.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Saddharma Pu&#7751;&#7693;ar&#299;ka</i>
(Kern, S.B.E., vol. xxi, p. 83), mention is made of a form of dwarf
demons, &ldquo;malign urchins, some of them measuring one span, others
one cubit or two cubits, all nimble in their movements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <i>Tales of the Punjab</i> (Mrs. Steel), p. 3 (<i>Wide-Awake
Stories</i>, p. 7), there is an account of a dwarf who was only one
cubit high; he had magical powers. In <i>Sagas from the Far East</i>,
p. 39, a demoness in the form of a woman one span high is mentioned
(see p. 171). In <i>Folklore of the Santal Parganas</i> (Rev. Dr.
Bodding), p. 189, there is an account of a man who was only a span
high. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the last mentioned work, p. 81, two men who were in a tree
frightened a R&#257;ja and his attendants by dropping a tiger&rsquo;s
paunch and beating a drum out of which flew a number of bees that they
had placed in it. These attacked and drove away the people below, and
the men got their goods.</p>
<p>In <i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. xiv, p. 135 (<i>Folklore in
Southern India</i>, p. 116), in a Tamil story by Pandit
Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;, a tiger which knew magic took
the form of a youth, married a girl who went off with him, and had a
son who was a tiger. The girl sent a message to her three brothers, and
they went to rescue her, taking an ass, an ant, a palmira tree, and a
washerman&rsquo;s iron tub that they found. They were put in the loft
by her. When the tiger told them to speak, one put the ant in the ear
of the ass, to make it bray. He then told them to show him their legs
and bellies; they held out the palmira tree and the tub, on seeing
which he ran off, and they escaped with her.</p>
<p>In <i>Old Deccan Days</i> (M. Frere), p. 229, a blind man and a deaf
man when going for a walk found and took with them a washerman&rsquo;s
ass, and the large pot in which he boiled clothes, and also put some
large black ants into a snuff-box. They took shelter from a storm in
the house of a R&#257;kshasa, and fastened the door. When the ogre
tried to enter, saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a R&#257;kshas,&rdquo; the
blind man replied, &ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re R&#257;kshas I&rsquo;m
B&#257;kshas, and B&#257;kshas is as good as R&#257;kshas.&rdquo; The
R&#257;kshasa asked to see his face and was shown the donkey&rsquo;s;
he asked to see his head and was shown the pot; he told him to scream,
and the ants were put in the ears of the ass, the braying of which
frightened the R&#257;kshasa away. When they went off next day with his
treasure, he came with six friends to kill them. They climbed up a tree
(as in the next variant), the ogres stood on each other&rsquo;s
shoulders to reach them, the blind man lost his balance, fell on the
uppermost one, and all tumbled down together. When the deaf man
shouted, &ldquo;Well done; hold on tight, I&rsquo;m coming to help
you,&rdquo; all the R&#257;kshasas ran away.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain village there were a Gamar&#257;la and a
Tom-tom Beater. For the Tom-tom Beater there was nothing to eat.
Because of it, having gone to the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house he got a
large basket of paddy on loan. While he was eating it the two persons
having joined together worked the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s two rice
fields.</p>
<p>Out of them, the [rice in the] Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s field being of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>very good quality was well developed; [that in]
the Tom-tom Beater&rsquo;s field was undeveloped. Because of it, the
arrangement which the Tom-tom Beater made was thus: &ldquo;Because I am
to give a debt to you, you take my rice field, please, and give me your
rice field, please,&rdquo; the Tom-tom Beater said to the
Gamar&#257;la. So the Gamar&#257;la having told him to take it, the
Gamar&#257;la took the Tom-tom Beater&rsquo;s field.</p>
<p>The Tom-tom Beater having cut the growing rice in the field and
trampled it [with buffaloes], got the paddy. The Gamar&#257;la obtained
hardly anything (<i lang="si-latn">&#7789;ikapi&#7789;ika</i>). So not
much time was occupied in eating it.</p>
<p>After that, a daughter of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s was taken away
by a R&#257;kshasa. Then the Gamar&#257;la having come near the Tom-tom
Beater, and said, &ldquo;Let us go on a search for my daughter,&rdquo;
both persons went together.</p>
<p>At that time the Gamar&#257;la took a bag of money. The Tom-tom
Beater, not showing it to the Gamar&#257;la, took a bag of fragments of
broken plates. The Gamar&#257;la tied up a bag of cooked rice; the
Tom-tom Beater tied up a bag of rice-dust porridge.</p>
<p>At the time when they were going, being hungry they stopped at the
bottom of a tree and made ready to eat the cooked rice. Having made
ready, the Tom-tom Beater, taking a small quantity of rice from the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s leaf [plate] of cooked rice, ate it.</p>
<p>Having eaten it, the Tom-tom Beater says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you eat
the cooked rice which I have polluted by eating; be good enough to eat
my bag of cooked rice.&rdquo; Having said it, he gave him the bag of
rice-dust porridge. Then when the Gamar&#257;la unfastened the bag
there was only porridge.</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;Well then, what [else] shall I do?&rdquo; the
Gamar&#257;la ate the rice-dust porridge. The Tom-tom Beater ate the
package of good cooked rice which the Gamar&#257;la brought. Thereupon
the Gamar&#257;la said at the hand of the Tom-tom Beater, &ldquo;I ate
the rice-dust porridge; don&rsquo;t tell anyone whatever,&rdquo; he
said. The Tom-tom Beater said, &ldquo;It is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time when they were going away, yet [another] Tom-tom Beater,
taking a drum to sell, came up. So this <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>Tom-tom Beater,
thinking of taking the drum, spoke to the Gamar&#257;la [about it].
Then the Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;If there is money in thy hand give
it, and take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tom-tom Beater, having shaken the package of plate fragments
said, &ldquo;There is money by me; I cannot unfasten it. If you have
money be good enough to give it.&rdquo; The Gamar&#257;la said,
&ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8593src" href=
"#xd27e8593" name="xd27e8593src">9</a></p>
<p>Then the Tom-tom Beater said, &ldquo;If so, I will say that you ate
the rice-dust porridge.&rdquo; Then the Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;Here
is money,&rdquo; and gave it. So the Tom-tom Beater got the drum.</p>
<p>Taking it, at the time when they were going along the path again, a
man came taking a deer-hide rope. That, also, the Tom-tom Beater having
thought of taking, in the very same way as at first he asked the
Gamar&#257;la for money. The Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;I will not give
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Tom-tom Beater said, &ldquo;I will say that you ate the
rice-dust porridge.&rdquo; Then having said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say
it,&rdquo; the Gamar&#257;la gave the money.</p>
<p>After that, the Tom-tom Beater taking the deer-hide rope, at the
time when they were going along the road, a man came bringing a pair of
elephant tusks.</p>
<p>Then the Tom-tom Beater in the very same way as at first asked the
Gamar&#257;la for money. The Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;I will not
[give it].&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Tom-tom Beater said, &ldquo;If so, I will say that you ate
the rice-dust porridge.&rdquo; Then the Gamar&#257;la, having said,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it,&rdquo; gave the money.</p>
<p>The Tom-tom Beater taking the pair of elephant tusks, they went to
the R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s house. When they went, the R&#257;kshasa
having gone for human flesh food, only the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s
daughter was [there]. The girl quickly having given food to the two
persons, the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughter told them to go to the
upper story floor.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8618src" href=
"#xd27e8618" name="xd27e8618src">10</a> Afterwards the Gamar&#257;la
and the Tom-tom Beater went to the upper story floor.</p>
<p>In the evening, the R&#257;kshasa having come said, &ldquo;Smell of
fresh human flesh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughter said, &ldquo;Having come
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>[after] eating fresh human flesh, what smell of
human flesh!&rdquo; After that the R&#257;kshasa without speaking lay
down.</p>
<p>Then at the time of dawn the Tom-tom Beater was minded to chant
verses, so he spoke to the Gamar&#257;la [about it]. The Gamar&#257;la
said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak.&rdquo; Without listening to it he
chanted verses softly, softly (<i lang="si-latn">hemin hemin</i>).</p>
<p>Thereupon the R&#257;kshasa having arisen, asked, &ldquo;Who art
thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tom-tom Beater said, &ldquo;I myself am the
R&#257;kshas&#299;s-eating Pr&#257;kshasa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshasa said, &ldquo;If so, show me thy teeth.&rdquo;
The Tom-tom Beater showed him the pair of elephant tusks.</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshasa, becoming afraid, said, &ldquo;Show me the
hair of thy head.&rdquo; The Tom-tom Beater showed him the deer-hide
rope.</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshasa said, &ldquo;If that be so, let us
roar.&rdquo; Then having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; the Tom-tom
Beater began to beat on the drum. The R&#257;kshasa becoming [more]
frightened, said that he was going near his preceptor, and ran away.
Then the Tom-tom Beater and the Gamar&#257;la, in order to get hidden,
went into the midst of the forest of Palmira trees.</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshasa, placing his preceptor in front, came up to
go through the middle of the forest of Palmira trees. At that time,
having seen the two R&#257;kshasas, these two persons being afraid
prepared to climb two trees. Thereupon the Tom-tom Beater, taking the
drum, went up the tree. The Gamar&#257;la being unable to go up the
tree, having gone to the middle of the tree, slid down [with a]
<i lang="si-latn">s&#299;ri s&#299;ri</i> [noise] to the ground.</p>
<p>Thereupon the two R&#257;kshasas came near the Gamar&#257;la. Then
the Tom-tom Beater, from the top of the tree, having shaken the leaves
and beaten the drum first, said, &ldquo;After I descend leave the big
one for me, and do thou eat the little one.&rdquo; Then the two
R&#257;kshasas becoming afraid, ran off.</p>
<p>Then the Tom-tom Beater descended from the tree, and again having
gone with the Gamar&#257;la to the R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s house, taking
the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s daughter and the goods that were in the
R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s house they came to their village. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
<p>While at the village the Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;Take thou the
goods; after the girl was there it is sufficient for me.&rdquo; Then
the Tom-tom Beater having brought [home] the goods became very
wealthy.</p>
<p>After a little time had gone by since that, the Gamar&#257;la came
to the Tom-tom Beater&rsquo;s house to take the debt of paddy. Then
what does the Tom-tom Beater do? Before the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s
coming, a very large basket was tied up [by him], shells and chaff
having been put in it.</p>
<p>After the Gamar&#257;la went, the Tom-tom Beater said,
&ldquo;Because of you, indeed, I have tied up that basket. If you want
it, be good enough to take it and go.&rdquo; Then the Gamar&#257;la
having gone and opened the mouth of the basket, when he looked there
were only shells and chaff.</p>
<p>Thereupon, at the time when the Gamar&#257;la was asking,
&ldquo;What is this chaff?&rdquo; the Tom-tom Beater said,
&ldquo;Apoyi! What has happened here? Through your bad luck there were
other things, indeed! In that way, indeed, you came down from the
Palmira tree that day,&rdquo; the Tom-tom Beater said.</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la, without speaking, went home without the
paddy.</p>

S&#257;str&#299;, two men who had previously frightened some
bh&#363;tas, or evil spirits, were belated at night in a wood they
haunted, so they climbed up a tree for safety. The bh&#363;tas
afterwards came there with torches in search of animals for food, and
this so terrified one of the men that he fell down among them. The

left by the tigers, the fak&#299;r became so alarmed when he heard the
tiger King using threatening language against them, that he lost his
hold and fell into the midst of the tigers. The barber instantly cried
out loudly, &ldquo;Now cut off their ears,&rdquo; on hearing which the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a Gamar&#257;la and a
Tom-tom Beater, it is said. The Gamar&#257;la having become very poor
had not a thing to eat. That Tom-tom Beater was a very rich man.</p>
<p>While they were thus, one day the two persons having spoken about
going on a journey and said, &ldquo;Let us go to-morrow,&rdquo; made
ready. There being not a thing for the Gamar&#257;la to eat before
going, and being without a thing to take for the road, [after] stirring
with a spoon a little rice-dust porridge and taking the porridge to the
road, he was ready to go.</p>
<p>The Tom-tom Beater, having amply cooked rice and curry, and eaten,
tying up a packet of cooked rice for the road also, went to the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house. Having gone there, the two persons went on
the journey. The Gamar&#257;la took the rice-dust porridge, the Tom-tom
Beater took the packet of cooked rice.</p>
<p>Having gone on and on, after it became late in the morning the
Tom-tom Beater said, &ldquo;H&#257;. Now then, Gamar&#257;hami, let us
eat the packet of cooked rice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Gamar&#257;la having said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and
both of them having unfastened the two bags, the Tom-tom Beater, taking
the packet of cooked rice, eats it. When the Gamar&#257;la was taking
the rice-dust porridge the Tom-tom Beater asked, &ldquo;What,
Gamar&#257;hami, are those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;In order to cook rice for myself
quickly, I came [after] cooking porridge. Don&rsquo;t tell it at the
hand of anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tom-tom Beater says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Gamar&#257;hami, I shall
not tell it. The gentleman (<i lang="si-latn">R&#257;hami</i>) will be
good enough to eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two persons having eaten and finished, when they are going on
again, a man is going taking a rice pestle to sell. Then this Tom-tom
Beater says to the Gamar&#257;la, &ldquo;An&#275;! Gamar&#257;hami, be
good enough to take and give me that rice pestle.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la says, &ldquo;Where, Bolat,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8713src" href="#xd27e8713" name="xd27e8713src">11</a> have I the
money [for it]?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Tom-tom Beater says, &ldquo;If so, I will say that the
Gamar&#257;hami ate rice-dust porridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Gamar&#257;la,&mdash;there is a little money in his
hand,&mdash;having given from it, taking the rice pestle, gave it to
the Tom-tom Beater.</p>
<p>Again, when they had gone a great distance, a man is coming taking a
[wooden] rice mortar to sell. So the Tom-tom Beater again says,
&ldquo;Gamar&#257;hami, Gamar&#257;hami, take that rice mortar, and be
good enough to give me it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Bolat, come thou on
without speaking there. Where have I money to that extent, to take and
give you those things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Tom-tom Beater says, &ldquo;If so, I will say that the
Gamar&#257;hami ate rice-dust porridge.&rdquo; Afterwards the
Gamar&#257;la took and gave him the rice mortar also.</p>
<p>Again, when they had gone a great distance, a man is going taking a
millet stone (quern) to sell. The Tom-tom Beater says,
&ldquo;Gamar&#257;lahami, you must indeed take and give me that millet
stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, anger having come to the Gamar&#257;la, he says,
&ldquo;O Vish&#7751;u!<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8737src" href=
"#xd27e8737" name="xd27e8737src">12</a> Bolat, where have I money to
that extent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Tom-tom Beater says, &ldquo;If so, I will say that the
Gamar&#257;hami ate rice-dust porridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Gamar&#257;la having given money to the man who
owned the millet stone, taking the millet stone gave it to the Tom-tom
Beater.</p>
<p>Taking that also, again when they are going a great distance a
Tom-tom Beater is coming, taking a tom-tom. Again that Tom-tom Beater
says to the Gamar&#257;la, &ldquo;Gamar&#257;hami, be good enough to
take and give me that tom-tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la says, &ldquo;And&#333;! I having come with
this Tom-tom Beater lump,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8749src" href=
"#xd27e8749" name="xd27e8749src">13</a> [see] what is happening to me!
Where is the money to take and give these things in this
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said [this], and given money to the man who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>owned the tom-tom, taking the tom-tom and having
given it to the Tom-tom Beater, again they go on.</p>
<p>When the Tom-tom Beater, taking the rice pestle, and the rice
mortar, and the millet stone, and the tom-tom, all of them, was going
with the Gamar&#257;la it became night. After that, they went to a
house to ask for a resting-place. The house was a R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s
house. The R&#257;kshasa was not at home; only the
R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s wife was at home. This Gamar&#257;la and Tom-tom
Beater asked at the hand of the woman for a resting-place.</p>
<p>Then the woman says, &ldquo;An&#275;! What have you come here for?
This indeed is a R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s house. The R&#257;kshasa having
come and eaten you also, will eat me. Before he comes go away
quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards these two persons say, &ldquo;An&#275;! Don&rsquo;t say
so. There is no place for us to go to now. Somehow or other you must
give us a resting-place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, this woman said, &ldquo;If so, remain without speaking,
having gone to that upper story floor.&rdquo; Thereupon these two
persons ascended to the upper floor, and stayed [there].</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshasa having come, asked at the hand of the woman,
&ldquo;What, Bola, is this smell of a human body that came, a human
body that came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman says, &ldquo;What is this thing that you are saying! Every
day you are eating fresh human flesh indeed; how should there not be a
corpse smell?&rdquo; After that, the R&#257;kshasa without speaking lay
down.</p>
<p>Then to the Gamar&#257;la says the Tom-tom Beater,
&ldquo;Gamar&#257;hami, I must go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la says, &ldquo;Remain without speaking. Now then,
after the R&#257;kshasa has come he will eat us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this Tom-tom Beater says, &ldquo;If so, I will say you ate
rice-dust porridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Gamar&#257;la says, &ldquo;Owing to this one, indeed,
I shall not be allowed to save my life and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa having heard the talk, said, &ldquo;What, Bola, is
that I hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman says, &ldquo;On the upper story floor the coconut
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>leaves are shaking.&rdquo; At that, also, the
R&#257;kshasa remained without speaking.</p>
<p>Again that Tom-tom Beater says, &ldquo;Gamar&#257;hami, I must go
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la says, &ldquo;The Gods be witnesses! Endless
times, having heard the talk, the R&#257;kshasa asked at the hand of
the woman, &lsquo;What is that I hear?&rsquo; Now then, having come on
this journey indeed, he will eat us. What shall I do? Let him eat, on
account of my foolishness in coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Tom-tom Beater says, &ldquo;If so, I will say you ate
rice-dust porridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa, having heard that talk also, again asked at the
hand of the woman, &ldquo;What, Bola, is that I hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman says, &ldquo;What is it, An&#275;! App&#257;! that
you are making happen to-day? There is very much wind; owing to it will
the coconut leaves stay without waving about?&rdquo; At that time also,
having said, &ldquo;Ah&#257;,&rdquo; the R&#257;kshasa remained without
speaking.</p>
<p>Then the Tom-tom Beater again says, &ldquo;Gamar&#257;hami, I have
the mind to beat a tom-tom verse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;What is the reason why you (<i lang=
"si-latn">om&#774;bahe&#7789;a</i>) have such a mind to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tom-tom Beater says, &ldquo;So indeed! I will say that you ate
rice-dust porridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;Beat very slightly and slowly,
so that [the sound] will not come even to the ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tom-tom Beater having said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; very loudly
beat, &ldquo;Dombitan&#805;, Dombitan&#805;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then when the R&#257;kshasa, without asking the woman [about this
noise] was ascending a great distance along the ladder, in order to go
to the upper floor, the Tom-tom Beater dropped the rice pestle on the
R&#257;kshasa, and dropped the rice mortar. When he dropped the millet
stone the R&#257;kshasa died.</p>
<p>The Tom-tom Beater, taking the tom-tom, went to his village. The
Gamar&#257;la calling the R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s wife [in marriage]
remained at the R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s village.</p>

ate Paddy Dust.</span> (Variant <i>d</i>.)</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country a Padu<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8828src" href="#xd27e8828" name="xd27e8828src">14</a> man, and an
Appuh&#257;mi<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8836src" href="#xd27e8836"
name="xd27e8836src">15</a> having joined together, went away on a
journey, it is said. Of the two persons, the Padu man tied up for
himself a packet of cooked rice, the Appuh&#257;mi tied up for himself
a packet of paddy dust, it is said.</p>
<p>Those two persons having gone taking the two packets, when the time
for eating cooked rice in the daytime arrived they halted at one spot,
and having become ready to eat cooked rice, unfastened the two packets,
it is said. At the time when they unfastened the two packets, the two
persons mutually saw the Padu man&rsquo;s cooked rice and curry, and
the Appuh&#257;mi&rsquo;s paddy dust. Having seen them, without having
spoken they ate the food in their own packets, and having stayed a
little time, set off and went away.</p>
<p>When they are going a considerable distance, a man came, bringing a
tom-tom (<i lang="si-latn">berayak</i>) to sell.</p>
<p>The Padd&#257; having asked the price of the tom-tom from the man
who brings the tom-tom to sell, said to the Appuh&#257;mi,
&ldquo;Please take and give me this tom-tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then anger having gone to the Appuh&#257;mi [he said], &ldquo;Be
off, dolt!<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8858src" href="#xd27e8858" name=
"xd27e8858src">16</a> That I should come with thee being insufficient,
thou toldest me to take and give thee this tom-tom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good, Appuh&#257;mi. If so, I will mention the evidence
that you ate paddy dust,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Appuh&#257;mi having become afraid, and having said,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Bola, I will take and give thee the tom-tom.
Don&rsquo;t tell any one about the matter of the dust eating,&rdquo;
took and gave the tom-tom to the Padd&#257;.</p>
<p>Taking the tom-tom, when they are going a considerable distance,
still [another] man brought a devil-dancer&rsquo;s mask (<i lang=
"si-latn">wes-muhuna</i>) to sell. The Padd&#257; having asked the
price <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>of the mask, said, &ldquo;Appuh&#257;mi, please
take and give me this mask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;Be off, dolt! Having taken and given thee a
tom-tom, am I to take and give thee a mask too?&rdquo; the
Appuh&#257;mi scolded the Padd&#257;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, I will mention the matter of the dust eating,&rdquo;
he said. Thereupon the Appuh&#257;mi having become afraid, took and
gave the mask.</p>
<p>Taking also the mask, when they are going a considerable distance,
yet [another] man brought a pair of devil-dancer&rsquo;s hawk&rsquo;s
bells to sell. The Padd&#257; having asked the price of the bells also,
and having said, &ldquo;Appuh&#257;mi, take and give me this pair of
bells,&rdquo; when the Appuh&#257;mi said he would not, &ldquo;If so, I
shall mention the evidence that you ate the dust,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the Appuh&#257;mi having become afraid, and having said,
&ldquo;Now then, having taken and given thee anything thou art telling
and telling [me to give], my money is done, too,&rdquo; took and gave
the pair of bells.</p>
<p>After that, again having gone a considerable distance they descended
to a great abandoned village. When they were going a considerable
distance in the village they saw that there is a house. These two
persons at the time when it was becoming evening went to that house.
The house was a R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s daughter having been [there] and
having wept says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Brothers,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8886src" href="#xd27e8886" name="xd27e8886src">17</a> our mother
is a R&#257;kshas&#299;. She is not at home now; at this time she will
be coming. As soon as mother comes,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8890src"
href="#xd27e8890" name="xd27e8890src">18</a> seizing you two she will
eat you. Having gone to any possible place, escape,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>The Appuh&#257;mi through fear began to tremble. The Padd&#257;
says, &ldquo;Why, younger sister? This night where are we to go? By any
possible method get us inside the house,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, you two, not talking, having ascended to this
store-loft (<i lang="si-latn">a&#7789;uwa</i>) sit down,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>The Appuh&#257;mi and the Padd&#257; having climbed up to the
store-loft, stayed [there].</p>
<p>After a little time the R&#257;kshas&#299; came. When she asked,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>&ldquo;What is the smell of human flesh?&rdquo;
the daughter says, &ldquo;Why, mother? Night and day continually having
eaten and eaten human flesh and having come, why do you ask me what is
the smell of human flesh?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the R&#257;kshas&#299;, not speaking, went to sleep,
together with the daughter.</p>
<p>The Padd&#257; sitting above in the store-loft says to the
Appuh&#257;mi, &ldquo;An&#275;! Appuh&#257;mi, it was in my mind to
dance a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Appuh&#257;mi says, &ldquo;Cah&#803;, Bola! Dolt! You
are preparing to dance; I am hiding in fear. Shouldst thou go for thy
dancing, the R&#257;kshas&#299; having killed us both will seize and
eat us,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, I will mention the fact that the Appuh&#257;mi ate the
dust,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Appuh&#257;mi then says, &ldquo;If so, having taken and placed
the tom-tom aside, do thou imagine that thou hast beaten the tom-tom;
bringing the devil-dancer&rsquo;s mask near thy face, imagine that thou
hast tied it on; and imagining that thou hast tied the pair of bells on
thy two legs, having taken and taken all, put them on one side,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>And the Padd&#257;, having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; tying on
well the devil-dancer&rsquo;s mask and having made it tight, and tying
the pair of bells on his two legs, and tying the tom-tom at his waist,
saying &ldquo;H&#363;&rdquo; with great strength, sprang down from the
store-loft to the place where the R&#257;kshas&#299; was sleeping; and
began to dance.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshas&#299; having become afraid, asked her daughter,
&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, isn&rsquo;t that the R&#257;kshasas-eating
Pr&#257;kshasa?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8924src" href=
"#xd27e8924" name="xd27e8924src">19</a> she said.</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshas&#299;, having become afraid and having gone
running, being unable to escape sprang into a well. The Padd&#257;
having also gone running just behind her, and having rolled into the
well some great stones, killed the R&#257;kshas&#299;.</p>
<p>After that, he took in marriage even the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s
daughter. The Appuh&#257;mi went away to his village.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Story of the Cake Tree</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a woman, and a
youngster, and a girl, it is said. The woman is a Yaksan&#299;.</p>
<p>One day the youngster said, &ldquo;Mother, let us cook
cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Yaksan&#299; said, &ldquo;Son, for us to cook cakes, whence
[can we get] the things for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, this youngster having gone to the place where they were
pounding flour, and having come back [after] placing a little flour
under the corner of his finger nail, said, &ldquo;Mother, mother, hold
a pot,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Yaksan&#299; held a pot. Then he struck down the finger nail;
then the pot having filled, overflowed.</p>
<p>Again, having gone to a place where they were expressing [oil from]
coconuts, and having come [after] placing a little oil under the corner
of his finger nail, &ldquo;Mother, mother, hold a pot,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The Yaksan&#299; held a pot. Then the youngster struck down the
finger nail; then the pot having filled, overflowed.</p>
<p>After that, the youngster having gone to a place where they were
warming [palm] syrup, and having come [after] placing a little syrup
under the corner of his finger nail, &ldquo;Mother, mother, hold a
pot,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Yaksan&#299; held a pot. The youngster struck down the finger
nail; then the pot having filled, overflowed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8960src" href="#xd27e8960" name="xd27e8960src">1</a></p>
<p>After that, the youngster said, &ldquo;Mother, now then, cook
cakes.&rdquo; Having said it, the youngster went to school.</p>
<p>During the time while he was going and was there, the Yaksan&#299;
and the girl having cooked cakes, and the Yaksan&#299; and the girl
having eaten all the cakes, placed for the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>youngster a cake that fell on the ash-heap while
they were cooking; and both of them remained without speaking.</p>
<p>Then the youngster having been at school, came home. Having come, he
asked that Yaksan&#299;, &ldquo;Mother, where are the cakes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Yaksan&#299; said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, the cooked cakes
the flour people took away, the oil people took away, the syrup people
took away. The cake which fell on the ash-heap while [we were] cooking
is there. There; eat even that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, when the youngster looked on the ash-heap there was a
cake on it. Having taken it, and planted it in the chena jungle, he
said, &ldquo;When I come to-morrow, may the Cake tree (<i lang=
"si-latn">k&aelig;wun gaha</i>), having sprouted, be [here].&rdquo;
Having said it he came home.</p>
<p>Having gone on the following day, when he looked a Cake tree had
sprouted. Afterwards the youngster said, &ldquo;When I come to-morrow,
may flowers having blossomed be [on it].&rdquo; Having said it he came
home.</p>
<p>Afterwards having gone, when he looked flowers had blossomed. After
that, the youngster said, &ldquo;When I come to-morrow, may cakes
having fruited be [on it].&rdquo; Having said it he came home.</p>
<p>Having gone on the following day, when he looked there were cakes.
After that, the youngster having ascended the tree, ate the cakes.</p>
<p>Then the Yaksan&#299; having gone [there], sitting at the bottom of
the tree said, &ldquo;Son, a cake for me also.&rdquo; The woman having
taken a sack also, put it [there].</p>
<p>Afterwards the youngster threw down a cake. Then the Yaksan&#299;
falsely said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, it fell into the spittle
heap.&rdquo; The youngster again threw one down. Then the Yaksan&#299;
said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, it fell into the mucus heap.&rdquo;
Afterwards the youngster again threw one down. Then also the
Yaksan&#299; said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, it fell into the cow-dung
heap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;Not so; holding them with your hand and mouth
jump into the sack,&rdquo; she held the sack, through wanting to eat
the youngster. Then the youngster, holding them with the hand and
mouth, jumped into the sack. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href=
"#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>After that, the Yaksan&#299;, tying the sack, came away. In a rice
field certain men were ploughing. Having placed the sack very near
there, the Yaksan&#299; went seven gawwas (twenty-eight miles) away
[for necessary reasons].</p>
<p>Thereupon that youngster says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Unfasten this sack,
some one who is in this rice field.&rdquo; Then the men who were very
near having heard it, unfastened the sack<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e8997" title="Not in source">.</span> After that, the youngster
having come out, put a great many ploughed-up clods from a plot of the
field into the sack, and again having tied the sack in the very way in
which it was [before], and placed it there, the youngster again went to
the Cake tree and ate.</p>
<p>Then the Yaksan&#299; having come, and taken the sack, and gone
home, and placed it [there], said to the girl, &ldquo;Daughter, this
one is in the sack. Unfasten this, and having cut up this one, and
placed the bowl of [his] blood beneath the stile, place the flesh on
the hearth [to cook].&rdquo; Having said it the Yaksan&#299; went
away.</p>
<p>After that, the girl having unfastened the sack, when she looked the
youngster was not in it; there were a great many ploughed-up clods.
Afterwards the girl having thrown aside the ploughed-up clods, put the
sack in the house.</p>
<p>The Yaksan&#299; came back. Having come, when she looked beneath the
stile there was no bowl of blood. Having gone near the hearth, when she
looked there was no flesh. After that, she asked at the hand of the
girl, &ldquo;Daughter, why didn&rsquo;t you cut up that one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl [said], &ldquo;Mother, there was a sort of ploughed-up
clods in the sack; having thrown them aside I put the sack in the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Yaksan&#299; said, &ldquo;If so, daughter, give me the
sack;&rdquo; and asking for the sack, and having gone near the Cake
tree, when she looked the youngster was eating cakes in the tree.</p>
<p>Sitting down near the tree she said, &ldquo;Son, a cake for me
also.&rdquo; Afterwards the youngster threw down a cake. Then the
Yaksan&#299; said, &ldquo;Son, it fell here, into the spittle
heap.&rdquo; The youngster again threw one down. Then the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>Yaksan&#299; [said], &ldquo;Son, it fell into
the mucus heap.&rdquo; The youngster again threw one down. Then the
Yaksan&#299; said, &ldquo;An&#275;, Son, it fell into the cow-dung
heap. Not so, son. Holding them with the hand and mouth jump into the
sack.&rdquo; After that, the youngster, holding them with the hand and
mouth, jumped into the sack.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the Yaksan&#299;, in that very manner tying the sack and
taking it, went away; and again having placed it in that rice field,
went to the very quarter to which she went at first.</p>
<p>Then the youngster said, &ldquo;Unfasten this sack, some one who is
in this rice field.&rdquo; Having heard it, those men unfastened the
sack. Then the youngster having come out, caught a great number of rat
snakes; and having put them in the sack, and tied it in that very way,
and placed it there, the youngster again went to the Cake tree and ate
cakes.</p>
<p>Then the Yaksan&#299; having come, and taken the bag also, and gone
home, told the girl, &ldquo;Daughter, cut up this one, and having
placed the bowl of [his] blood beneath the stile, put the flesh on the
hearth.&rdquo; Having said it she went away.</p>
<p>After that, the girl having unfastened the sack, when she looked
there were a great many rat snakes [in it]. The girl having waited
until the time when the rat snakes went off, put the sack in the
house.</p>
<p>Then the Yaksan&#299; having come, when she looked if the bowl of
blood was beneath the stile, it was not [there]; when she looked if the
flesh was on the hearth, that also was not [there]. After that she
asked at the hand of the girl, &ldquo;Daughter, didn&rsquo;t you cut up
that one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl says, &ldquo;Mother, in it there were a great many rat
snakes. Having waited there until the time when they went off, I put
the sack in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Yaksan&#299; [said], &ldquo;If so, daughter, give me
that sack;&rdquo; and asking for the sack, and having gone near the
Cake tree, when she looked this youngster was eating cakes.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Yaksan&#299;, sitting down, said, &ldquo;Son, a cake
for me also.&rdquo; The youngster threw down a cake. Then <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>the
Yaksan&#299; said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, it fell into the spittle
heap.&rdquo; Afterwards the youngster again threw one down. Then the
Yaksan&#299; said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, it fell into the mucus
heap.&rdquo; The youngster again threw one down. Then the Yaksan&#299;
[said], &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, it fell into the cow-dung heap. Not so,
son. Holding them with the hand and mouth jump into the sack.&rdquo;
Afterwards the youngster, holding them with the hand and mouth, jumped
into the sack.</p>
<p>After that, the Yaksan&#299; tied the sack, and placing it on her
head and having come quite home, and placed the sack in the veranda,
said to the girl, &ldquo;Daughter, to-day indeed that one is [here].
Cut up that one, and having placed the bowl of [his] blood beneath the
stile, place the flesh on the hearth.&rdquo; Having said it she went
away.</p>
<p>Afterwards this girl having unfastened the sack, when she looked the
youngster was [in it]. Having brought the bill-hook, when she was about
(<i>lit.</i>, making) to cut up the youngster, the youngster said,
&ldquo;Elder sister, don&rsquo;t cut me up just now. Lie down here for
me to comb your head.&rdquo; After that, the girl lay down.</p>
<p>As he was combing and combing the head, this girl went to sleep.
Afterwards, this youngster having cut the girl&rsquo;s throat
(<i>lit.</i>, neck), placed the bowl of [her] blood beneath the stile,
and having put the flesh on the hearth, the youngster, taking a rice
mortar, and a pestle, and a millet [grinding] stone,&mdash;at the
doorway there was a Palmira [palm] tree&mdash;ascended the Palmira
tree.</p>
<p>While he was there the Yaksan&#299; came, and having drunk the bowl
of blood that was beneath the stile, and come near the hearth and taken
the flesh that was on the hearth, began to eat.</p>
<p>While she was eating it, the youngster, being in the Palmira tree,
says thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;They themselves eat their own children.</p>

flesh.</p>
<p>Then that youngster again says,</p>

in front of the house, when she looked up the tree the youngster was
there. Afterwards the Yaksan&#299; said, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Stop
there. [I am going] to eat this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she was setting off to go up the tree that youngster let go the
pestle. The Yaksan&#299;, saying and saying, &ldquo;Thou art unable to
kill me,&rdquo; goes upward.</p>
<p>After that, that youngster let go the rice mortar; then the
Yaksan&#299; fell to the ground. Then that youngster let go the millet
stone; then the Yaksan&#299; died. Only the youngster remained.</p>

<p class="first">In the Kolh&#257;n tales (Bompas) appended to
<i>Folklore of the Santal Parganas</i> (Rev. Dr. Bodding), p. 464,
occurs an Indian version of this peculiar story. A boy whose mother
gave him two pieces of bread daily, one day left one on a rock and
found next morning that a tree which bore bread as fruit had grown from
it. When he was in the tree eating the fruit one day, a woman who was
really a R&#257;kshas&#299; came up and asked for a loaf, and saying
that if it fell on the ground it would become dirty, induced him to
descend with it. She then put him in her bag and went off. While she
was getting a drink at a pool some travellers let the boy out. He
filled the bag with stones. On reaching her home the woman told her
daughter she had brought a fine dinner, but the daughter found only
stones in the bag. Next day the woman returned to the tree, secured the
boy in the same way, brought him to her daughter, and went to collect
firewood. In reply to the boy, the girl said he was to be killed by
being pounded in a mortar; while she showed him how it was to be done
he killed her with the pestle, put on her clothes, and cut her up. The
ogress returned, cooked and ate her, and went to sleep, on which the
boy struck her on the head with a large stone, killed her, and took all
her property. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a female Crow and a
male Crow. While they were thus, the female Crow having thought of
eating cakes, went with the male Crow to break firewood. Having gone,
[after] breaking firewood the male Crow took a bundle of firewood [and
came away with it].</p>
<p>When the female Crow was there unable to lift up her bundle of
firewood, she saw that a lad who looks after cattle was going by, and
having called to him, when she said, &ldquo;Son, lift up the bundle of
firewood and go; I will give you cakes,&rdquo; the lad lifted it up and
gave her it, and went away.</p>
<p>After that, the lad having come to eat cakes, when he asked for
cakes the female Crow gave him cakes.</p>
<p>The lad, having gone away taking the cakes, and ascended a tree,
when he was eating them a R&#257;kshas&#299; came. When she looked up
the tree, having seen a lad eating cakes, she said, &ldquo;An&#275;!
Son, throw down cakes for me also.&rdquo; So the lad threw down a cake.
Having said, &ldquo;It is in the dung-heap,&rdquo; she told him to
throw down one more. Thereupon the lad threw down one more. &ldquo;That
also is in the dung-heap,&rdquo; she said. After all were finished in
that way, the R&#257;kshas&#299; says to the lad, &ldquo;Now then, son,
tying both legs and both hands jump into this bag,&rdquo; she said.
Then the lad jumped.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshas&#299; having put the lad in the bag, and [after]
tying it having gone home, gave it to the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s
daughter, and said, &ldquo;Fry this, and put it away until the time
when I come.&rdquo; Having said [this], the R&#257;kshas&#299; went
away somewhere or other.</p>
<p>After that, the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s daughter opened the bag,
and taking out the lad, told the lad to blow up the fire on the hearth.
Thereupon the lad says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know [how],&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Then when the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s daughter descends to the
hearth to show him, the lad pushed the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s
daughter into the oil cooking-pot that was on the hearth.</p>
<p>After she was fried, having taken it off and put it away,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there was a house of a
Gamar&#257;la, it is said. At that house there were seven children. Out
of the seven, the elder six persons having arisen on all days just at
daybreak, go to do work in the rice field. The young person for the
purpose of learning goes to school.</p>
<p>Having joined with yet [other] children (<i lang=
"si-latn">lam&#333;</i>), the party of children began to go near a
house at which a certain R&#257;kshas&#299; dwells at that village.
During the time when they are going thus, the R&#257;kshas&#299; who
saw these children, from the day on which she saw the children made
ready to seize and eat them.</p>
<p>Although she made ready in that manner, through fear because men
dwelt in the neighbourhood she did not seize the children. But the
R&#257;kshas&#299; being unable to remain without eating the children,
thought, &ldquo;Seizing the children by a certain device, I must employ
my daughter, and [after] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href=
"#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>boiling I must eat them.&rdquo;
Having broken off all the leaves of a tree that was on the road on
which the children go to school, and having wrapped strips of white
cloth at all places on the tree, and hung cakes and plantains, etc., at
all places on the tree, the R&#257;kshas&#299; got into the jungle and
waited.</p>
<p>At the time when she is staying thus, the party of children who are
going to school, when they approached the root of that tree having seen
the tree on which the cakes and plantains had been hung, said,
&ldquo;Look here, Bola; a Cake Tree;&rdquo; and the whole of them
having ascended the tree, plucked the cakes and plantains to the extent
to which they had been hung on the tree, and ate them.</p>
<p>That day, except that the R&#257;kshas&#299; had gone into the
jungle, she did not come to the place where the children are eating the
cakes and plantains. Why? It was through fear that many children having
come to the place where she is, at the time when she is seizing them
the children having become afraid, and run to that and this hand, when
they have told the men they will kill her.</p>
<p>Having thought thus, that day after the whole of the children,
plucking the cakes and plantains, went away, the R&#257;kshas&#299;
having come from the jungle into the open, arrived at her house, and
stayed [there]. On the following day also, as on the former day, at
daybreak having gone taking cakes and plantains, and hung them on the
tree, she got hid, and remained looking out.</p>
<p>That day, when she is thus, out of that troop of children going to
school, the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s child having arisen more towards
daybreak than on other days, and hurried, and eaten food, and drunk,
and gone in front of the other boys, with the thought that he must
pluck the cakes very quickly went that day quite alone. Having gone in
that way, he ascended the Cake Tree and began to pluck them. At the
time when he is thus plucking them, the R&#257;kshas&#299; having
sprung out, quickly taking the bag also, and having come to the bottom
of the tree, spoke to the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s boy, and says,
&ldquo;<span class="corr" id="xd27e9212" title=
"Source: Ad&#275;">A&#7693;&#275;</span>! Son, pluck and give me one
cake,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>When the R&#257;kshas&#299; said thus, he plucked one and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>gave it. The R&#257;kshas&#299; having thrown on
the ground that bit of cake says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, the cake fell
on the ground. Sand being rubbed on it, I cannot eat it. Give me still
one,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>At the time when she said thus, he plucked one more and gave it.
Having dropped that also on the ground, she says, &ldquo;An&#275;!
Having struck my hand that also fell on the ground. I cannot catch the
cakes that you are plucking and giving me. I will tell you a very easy
work; you do it. Plucking as many cakes as you can, jump into my bag.
Jumping in that way is easier than descending [by climbing down] the
tree,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>When the R&#257;kshas&#299; told him in that manner, this foolish
child, thinking, &ldquo;It is an easy work the R&#257;kshas&#299; is
telling me,&rdquo; and plucking as many as possible for both hands and
waist-pocket, jumped into the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s bag.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshas&#299;, tying the mouth of the bag and having gone
taking him without being visible to the men, arrived at her house, and
having spoken to the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s daughter, says,
&ldquo;Daughter, to-day I must eat a good flavour. In the bag that I
brought, placing it on my shoulder, there is a tasty meat. Boil the
meat for me and give me it.&rdquo; Having given it to her daughter, the
R&#257;kshas&#299; went about another thing that should be done.</p>
<p>When the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s daughter is unfastening the bag
to prepare the meat, there is a boy [in it]. When the
R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s daughter having unfastened the bag is going
to take the child out, having spoken he says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Elder
sister, there are lice on your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s daughter says,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Younger brother, if so, catch them.&rdquo; Having said
[this] she sat down.</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s son, having been for a little time turning
and turning over the hairs of her head to that and this side in the
manner when looking at the head, taking the axe that had been brought
to kill the boy, and at once having struck the head of the
R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s daughter and killed her, and having put her
in the cauldron of water which was there, and placed her on the hearth,
and boiled her, and made her ready and placed her to eat when the
R&#257;kshas&#299; is coming, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279"
href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>collecting the rice mortar,
pestle, and a great many knives that were at the house, and having gone
and placed them in a Palmira tree that is at the doorway,&mdash;at the
time when the R&#257;kshas&#299; comes this one having also ascended
the tree stayed [there].<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9234src" href=
"#xd27e9234" name="xd27e9234src">4</a></p>
<p>When the R&#257;kshas&#299; came [after] bathing, at the time when
she is coming she says, &ldquo;Daughter, even to-day has tasty food
been prepared? Don&rsquo;t do that work for the men of the village to
get news of it; if so, the men of the village will kill us.&rdquo;
Saying this, she came into the house.</p>
<p>Well then, except that having boiled the meat it is there to eat,
the daughter is not to be seen. While calling her on that and this
hand, at the time when she is seeking her that youth, sitting on the
Palmira tree, says, &ldquo;Their own flesh they themselves will eat. On
the Palmira tree at the doorway; &#7789;&#257;n, &#7789;&#363;n.&rdquo;
Saying [this] he began to beat a tom-tom (<i lang=
"si-latn">ram&#774;b&#257;na</i>).</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshas&#299; having looked up when coming running to
seize this one, this one threw at the R&#257;kshas&#299; the rice
mortar and pestle that he had taken to the top of the tree, and struck
her. The R&#257;kshas&#299; died at the bottom of the tree.</p>
<p>This one having descended from the tree, and gone home, and given
information to the other brothers of this circumstance, came with them,
and took away the goods of the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s that there
were. Having gone away they lived in happiness.</p>

<p class="first">In a certain country there were a Gamar&#257;la and a
Gama-Mahag&#275; (his wife). There was a female child of the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>After the child became suitable [for marriage] he went near the Lord
or monk of the pansala<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9269src" href=
"#xd27e9269" name="xd27e9269src">1</a> to look at her <i lang=
"si-latn">naekata</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9275src" href=
"#xd27e9275" name="xd27e9275src">2</a> The Gamar&#257;la said to the
monk, &ldquo;An&#275;! Lord, there is a female child of mine; the child
became suitable [for marriage]. You must look at the naekata,&rdquo; he
said to the Lord.</p>
<p>Thereafter, when the monk looked at the naekata, besides that it is
very good for both the parents, it was said in the naekata that the man
who calls her [in marriage] on that very day is to obtain a kingdom.
Because of it, the monk after having placed the Gamar&#257;la in
subjection (<i>i.e.</i>, made him promise obedience), said, &ldquo;The
naekata is very angry. For the two parents, and for the man who calls
her [in marriage], there is anger to the degree [that they are] to
die,&rdquo; he said to the Gamar&#257;la. This lie the monk said to the
Gamar&#257;la in order for the monk to call the female [in marriage]
for himself.</p>
<p>At that time the Gamar&#257;la, having become much troubled, asked
the Lord, &ldquo;What shall I do for this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monk said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill the child outright,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9287src" href="#xd27e9287" name="xd27e9287src">3</a>
and don&rsquo;t [merely] turn her out of the house. You go home
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>and make a box. After having made it, and made
ready for the box [various] sorts of food and drink, put this child in
the box, and having put into it the kinds of food and drink, after
having closed it go to the river, and put it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, the Gamar&#257;la having done in the manner the monk
said, and having informed the monk that on such and such a day he will
put the box in the river, went to the river and put the box in
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9295src" href="#xd27e9295" name=
"xd27e9295src">4</a></p>
<p>The monk told the pupils who were at the pansala to wait [for it].
He said, &ldquo;You go and wait near the river. At the time when you
are there a box will come floating down. Taking it ashore, bring it to
the pansala;&rdquo; the pupils went on the journey. The monk that day,
for the purpose of eating the [wedding] feast amply preparing [various]
sorts of food and drink, remained ready.</p>
<p>Two boys of that country, or two young men, had set a trap at the
bank [of the river]. At the time when these two persons went to look at
it, a leopard was caught in the trap. These two having become afraid,
having said, &ldquo;What shall we do about this?&rdquo; at the time
when they were talking and talking on the river bank, they saw that a
box is coming floating [down the river], and the two persons spoke
together [about it]. Both having agreed that the things inside the box
[should be] for one person, and the box for one person, they got the
box ashore.</p>
<p>Having opened the mouth of the box, when they looked [in it] there
were a woman, and [various] kinds of food and drink. Taking them aside,
they seized the leopard, and having put it in the box and shut it, they
took it to the river and put it in.</p>
<p>Out of the two persons, one took the woman, the effects one took.
The person who took the woman that very day obtained the kingdom, it
has been said.</p>
<p>Thereafter, that box floated down to the place where the
monk&rsquo;s pupils stayed. Getting the box ashore, and tying [it as] a
load (<i lang="si-latn">tadak</i>) for a carrying pole, they took it to
the pansala. The monk, taking the box, quickly placed it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>inside the house. The monk told the pupils to
stay: &ldquo;To-day I must say <i lang="si-latn">Bana</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9316src" href="#xd27e9316" name="xd27e9316src">5</a>
from a different treatise (<i lang="si-latn">s&#363;tra</i>); to-day
you must respond, &lsquo;S&#257;dhu,&rsquo; loudly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After it became night the monk told the pupils, &ldquo;You also lie
down,&rdquo; and having lit the lamp in the house, [after] shutting the
door he opened the mouth of the box. Just as he was opening it, the
leopard having sprung out, began to bite (<i>lit.</i>, eat) the monk.
Thereupon the monk cried out, &ldquo;Apoyi! The leopard is biting
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pupils began to respond, &ldquo;S&#257;dhu!&rdquo; louder than
on other days. At the time when the monk is shouting and shouting, the
pupils loudly, loudly, began to respond, &ldquo;S&#257;dhu!&rdquo; When
he had been crying and crying out no long time, the monk died.</p>
<p>In the morning, having cooked rice gruel for the obligatory donation
(<i lang="si-latn">h&#299;l d&#257;ne&#7789;a</i>), when they were
waiting, looking out for the time when the monk arose, he did not get
up. Until the time when it became well into the day (<i lang=
"si-latn">bohoma dawal</i>), they remained looking out. Still he did
not [come out].</p>
<p>An up&#257;saka (lay devotee) of that village comes every day to the
wih&#257;ra to offer flowers. He, too, remained looking out near the
wih&#257;ra until the time when the monk comes. Thereafter the
up&#257;sakar&#257;la having gone to the pansala, asked at the hand of
the pupils, &ldquo;What is the reason the Lord has not yet
arisen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the pupils said, &ldquo;During last night it was not the Bana
which he says on other days that he said; from another s&#363;tra he
said Bana. He told us, also, to respond &lsquo;S&#257;dhu&rsquo; more
loudly than on other days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time the up&#257;sakar&#257;la tapped at the door to awake
the monk; he did not speak. Having struck the door loudly [the
up&#257;sakar&#257;la] spoke to him. At that also there was not any
sound.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the up&#257;sakar&#257;la having mounted on the roof and
put aside the tiles, when he looked [down] the leopard sprang at him,
growling. The up&#257;sakar&#257;la having become afraid, fell from the
roof and died. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thereafter, many men having joined together and broken down the
door, and killed the leopard, when they looked for the monk he was
killed. So having put the leopard and the monk into one grave, they
covered [them with] earth.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In <i>The Orientalist</i>, vol. ii, p. 145, Mr. N.
Visuvanathapillai, Mudaliy&#257;r, relates this as a Tamil story. The
girl was Princess Devall&#299;; to save the country she was condemned
to death, but her mother bribed the executioners to set her afloat in
the river, in a box. A hunter who had trapped a tiger on the river bank
secured the box, released the Princess, and put in the tiger. The Guru
(teacher) had heard of the Queen&rsquo;s stratagem, and sent a dozen of
his pupils in a boat in search of the box. They brought it into a room
in a deserted building, and remained in an adjoining one, being
instructed to clap their hands and shout, &ldquo;Hail! Long life to our
Master!&rdquo; when they heard the box opened. Amid this applause of
the boys the tiger killed the Guru. (In <i>The Orientalist</i>, vol.
iii, p. 269, Mr. J. P. Lewis noted that this story is from the <i lang=
"sa-latn">Kath&#257; sint&#257;ma&#7751;i</i>).</p>
<p>In <i>Old Deccan Days</i> (M. Frere), p. 280, a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a
foretold that unless a baby Princess should be sent out of the country
she would destroy it utterly. The R&#257;ja her father caused her to be
placed in a box, which was launched on a river, and floated down. A
merchant saw it, and got a fisherman to bring it ashore, the box to go
to him and the contents to belong to the merchant. He got the Princess,
reared her, and married her to his son. The rest of the tale is the
legend of the Goddess Pattin&#299;, who caused Madura to be burnt in
revenge for the execution of her husband on a false charge of stealing
the Queen&rsquo;s bangle.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. i, p. 102, an ascetic told a merchant that when his daughter got
married all the family would die, and he advised him to set her adrift
in a basket on the Ganges. Her father having promised to do this, the
ascetic ordered his pupils to intercept the basket and bring it
secretly to his monastery. A Prince who had gone to bathe found and
opened the basket, married the girl by the G&#257;ndharva rite (in
which a garland of flowers is thrown round the neck), put a fierce
monkey in her place, and set the basket afloat again. The boys brought
it, and the ascetic placed it in a room to perform incantations alone,
he said. When he opened it the monkey flew at him and tore off his nose
and ears, and he became the laughing-stock of the place.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257;ko&ccedil;a</i> (Tawney), p. 132,
an ascetic informed a merchant that the bad luck of his two daughters
would bring about his destruction, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284"
href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>and advised him to set them
afloat in the Ganges in a wooden box, and cause a ceremony to be
performed for averting calamity. The ascetic performed the ceremony for
him, and sent his pupils to bring the box. The King of that city got
the box ashore, took the girls, and put two apes in their place. When
the ascetic opened the box at his monastery he was killed by the apes
and became a R&#257;kshasa.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i> (Knowles), 2nd ed., pp. 398, 399,
410, the incident occurs of newly-born infants being placed in boxes,
set afloat in a river, and rescued by a person lower down.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9390src" href="#xd27e9390" name="xd27e9390src">6</a>
At p. 445, a girl who had been married to a King was set afloat in a
box, and rescued by a washerman.</p>
<p>In <i>Sagas from the Far East</i>, p. 120, there is a Kalmuk variant
in which a man who desired to take the wealth of an old couple, got
inside a statue of Buddha, and instructed them to give their daughter
to the man who knocked at their gate in the morning. The man himself
came and knocked, and married her, and he and his new wife left with
all their gold and precious stones. A Khan&rsquo;s son who was out
hunting, taking a tiger with him, fired an arrow into a mound of sand;
it struck something hard which proved to be a box which the man had
placed there, containing the girl and jewels. The tiger was put in her
place, and when the man carried off and opened the box in an inner room
of his house it killed and ate him, and walked away next morning when
the door was opened. The Prince married the girl.</p>
<p>In the Sinhalese history, the <i lang="sa-latn">Mah&#257;vansa</i>,
p. 147 (Dr. Geiger&rsquo;s translation), it is stated that in order to
appease the sea-gods who had caused the sea to overflow the land on the
western coast of Ceylon in the first half of the second century
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>, the King of Kaela&#7751;iya &ldquo;with
all speed caused his pious and beautiful daughter named D&#275;v&#299;
to be placed in a golden vessel whereon was written &lsquo;a
king&rsquo;s daughter,&rsquo; and to be launched upon that same
sea.&rdquo; She was brought ashore at the extreme south-east of Ceylon,
and married by the King of Ruhu&#7751;a or Southern Ceylon.</p>
<p>The original Indian story of the child who was consigned to the
water in a basket or box appears to be that which is given in the
<i lang="sa-latn">Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata</i> (<i lang=
"sa-latn">Va&#7751;a Parva</i>). According to it, an unmarried
Princess, Kunt&#299;, who bore a supernatural son to the deity
S&#363;riya, the Sun, placed the infant in a water-tight wicker basket,
and set it afloat in the adjoining river, from which it passed down to
the Ganges, and then drifted down that river until it arrived near
Camp&#257;, the capital of the Anga kingdom. The basket was brought
ashore and opened by a car-driver who had gone to the river bank with
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>wife. These two, being childless, adopted the
infant, who afterwards became famous as Kar&#7751;a, the leading Kuru
warrior in the great battle against the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava
Princes and their allies.</p>
<p>The story extends backward to the legend or history of Sargon I, of
Akkad (about 2,650 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> according to the
revised chronology), who stated in an inscription that his mother, a
Princess, launched him on the Euphrates in a basket of rushes made
water-tight with bitumen. He was rescued and reared by a cultivator,
who placed him in charge of his garden. Through the affection of the
Goddess Istar he acquired the sovereignty. <span class=

he had cut, and in which he had sown grain, as he was walking along at
the edge of the fence, on this side of the corner of the stick fence a
tail was visible, it is said.</p>
<p>Having gone near very quietly, when he looked, a leopard lying at
the edge of the fence, having let its tail come inside the chena, was
asleep, it is said.</p>
<p>Thereupon, this man on this side of the fence seized the
leopard&rsquo;s tail which it had put there. After he seized it he
cannot kill it, he cannot let go; should he let go, the leopard will
kill the man.</p>
<p>When the man was staying [there] thinking, &ldquo;How is the
expedient for this?&rdquo; he saw a Washerman going along, taking a
bundle of clothes. So this man called him, saying,
&ldquo;Washerman-uncle, come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Washerman having come, asked, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Kill the leopard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Washerman said thus, &ldquo;An&#275;! His face is like our
uncle&rsquo;s. An&#275;! I indeed cannot kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who was holding the leopard, said, &ldquo;If so, I will kill

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a woman and a man, it
is said; there is also a boy of those two persons. In front of the
house there is also a Murung&#257; tree. A Yak&#257; having come,
remained seven years in the Murung&#257; tree in order to
&ldquo;possess&rdquo; the woman.</p>
<p>While they were in that manner, one day the man and the boy went on
a journey somewhere or other. The woman that day having [previously]
put away the bill-hook, brought it to the doorway, and while preparing
to cut a vegetable, said, &ldquo;This bill-hook is indeed good [enough]
to cut a Yak&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yak&#257; who stayed in the Murung&#257; tree at the doorway,
having heard what the woman said, became afraid, and having waited
until the time when the woman goes into the house [after] cutting the
vegetable, the Yak&#257; slowly descended from the Murung&#257;
tree.</p>
<p>When he was going away, the woman&rsquo;s husband and boy, having
gone on the journey, are coming back. The Yak&#257; met them. Then the
Yak&#257; asked at the hand of those two, &ldquo;Where did you go? I
stayed seven years in the Murung&#257; tree at the doorway of your
house, to &lsquo;possess&rsquo; your wife. To-day your wife, sharpening
a bill-hook, came to the doorway, and looking in my direction said,
&lsquo;This bill-hook is indeed good for cutting a Yak&#257;.&rsquo;
Because of it, I am here, going away. Don&rsquo;t you go; that wicked
woman will cut you. Come, and go with me; I will give you a means of
subsistence. I, having now gone in front, will &lsquo;possess&rsquo;
such and such a woman of such and such a village. You two having said
that you are Yaksa <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289"
name="pb289">289</a>]</span>Vedar&#257;las,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9481src" href="#xd27e9481" name="xd27e9481src">1</a> and having
come [there], when you have told me to go I will go. Then the men
having said that you are [really] Yaksa Vedar&#257;las, will give you
many things. When you have driven me from that woman, again I will
&lsquo;possess&rsquo; still [another] woman. Thus, in that manner,
until the time when the articles are sufficient for you, I will
&lsquo;possess&rsquo; women. When they have become sufficient do not
come [to drive me out].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said [this], the Yak&#257; went in front and
&ldquo;possessed&rdquo; the woman. After that, the man and the boy went
and drove out the Yak&#257;. From that day, news spread in the villages
that the two persons were Yaksa Vedar&#257;las. From that place the two
persons obtained articles.</p>
<p>The Yak&#257; having gone, &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; yet a woman also.
Having driven him from there, too, these two persons got articles. The
Yak&#257; &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; still [another] woman also. Thus, in
that manner, until the very time when the things were sufficient for
the two persons, the Yak&#257; &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; women.</p>
<p>After the articles became sufficient for the two persons, one day
the Yak&#257; said to the two, &ldquo;The articles are sufficient for
you, are they not?&rdquo; The two persons said, &ldquo;They are
sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Yak&#257; said, &ldquo;If so, I shall &lsquo;possess&rsquo;
the Queen of such and such a King. From there I shall not go.
Don&rsquo;t you come to drive me away.&rdquo; Having said it, the
Yak&#257; went to that city, and &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; the Queen.</p>
<p>The two Yaksa Vedar&#257;las came to their village, taking the
articles they had obtained. Then a message came from the King for the
Yaksa Vedar&#257;las to go. The two persons not having gone, remained
[at home], because of the Yak&#257;&rsquo;s having said that he would
not go.</p>
<p>After that, the King sent a message that if they did not come he
would behead the Yaksa Vedar&#257;las. After that, the two persons,
being unable to escape, went to drive out the Yak&#257;. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having gone there, they utter and utter spells for the Yak&#257; to
go. The Yak&#257; does not go. Anger came to the Yak&#257;. In anger
that, putting [out of consideration] his saying,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the two persons went and uttered spells, the
Queen whom the Yak&#257; has &ldquo;possessed,&rdquo; taking a rice
pestle, came turning round the house after him in three circles to kill
the Vedar&#257;la.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9500src" href=
"#xd27e9500" name="xd27e9500src">2</a> When she was raising the rice
pestle to strike the Vedar&#257;la, the man&rsquo;s boy said,
&ldquo;Look there, Yak&#257;! Our mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, because he had been afraid [of her] formerly, when the boy
said it, the Yak&#257;, saying, &ldquo;Where, Bola?&rdquo; and also
rolling the Queen over on the path, face upwards, and saying
&ldquo;H&#363;,&rdquo; went away. The Queen came to her senses.</p>
<p>The King gave the two persons many articles. The Yak&#257; did not
again come to &ldquo;possess&rdquo; women. That man and boy having come
to their village, and become very wealthy, remained without a
deficiency of anything.</p>

<p class="first">In <i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. xvi, p. 217
(<i>Folklore in Southern India</i>, p. 214), in a Tamil story related
by Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;, a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a was
turned by &#346;iva into a Brahma-R&#257;kshasa for refusing to impart
his knowledge of music to others, and he resided in a Pipal or B&#333;
tree. A poor Br&#257;hma&#7751;a of Sengalin&#299;rpa&#7789;&#7789;u
(Chingleput, land of the blue lotus) assisted him to escape from the
wretched music of a piper by removing into another tree, and out of
gratitude the demon &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; the Princess of
Mais&#363;r, in order that the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a might obtain wealth
by driving him out. Afterwards, when the demon &ldquo;possessed&rdquo;
the Princess of Travancore, intending to remain, the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a frightened him away by a threat that he would bring
back the piper.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Hindustan</i> (Shaik Chilli), p. 6, a
beggar&rsquo;s wife beat him with a stick for coming home foodless,
threw his turban into a tree and struck at it time after time, hitting
the tree at each blow. The blows and her abuse frightened away from the
tree the ghost or <i>Bh&#363;t</i> of a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a of the
family who had committed suicide. The ghost and the man travelled along
together as friends in misfortune. By their arrangement the man drove
the ghost from the Minister&rsquo;s daughter, but refused to officiate
when it &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; the Sultan&rsquo;s daughter, until
ordered to be executed. When <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href=
"#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>the ghost threatened to kill him
he told it he had terrible news, his wife would be there in a few
minutes. The ghost left at once, and the man married the Princess and
succeeded to the throne.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i> (Swynnerton), p. 298, a
man&rsquo;s termagant wife was thrown into a well, and there married a
demon, but in fear of her he soon hid as a man, in a mosque. Becoming
friendly with the former husband, who recognised him, he promised to
marry the man to the King&rsquo;s daughter, whom he thereupon
&ldquo;possessed.&rdquo; When the man drove him out she was given in
marriage to him, together with half the kingdom. The demon, after
warning him not to interfere, then &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; the
Minister&rsquo;s daughter. After at first refusing to act, the man
frightened him away by saying his former wife was coming.</p>
<p>In <i>The Enchanted Parrot</i> (Rev. B. H. Wortham), a variant is
given in the stories XLVI and XLVII. The woman terrified everyone
around, and a goblin who lived in a tree near her house ran away. The
husband also left, became friendly with him, and was advised to go and
cure the King&rsquo;s daughter. He cured her, married her, and received
half the kingdom. Then the goblin carried off this Princess. The man
went in search of her, and frightened away the goblin by whispering
that his wife was coming. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href=

<h2 class="main">The Story of the Seven Yak&#257;s</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a woman and a man, it
is said. One day the man went to plough. The woman placed a ripe
pine-apple underneath the bed.</p>
<p>On the very day she put it [there], seven Yak&#257;s having joined
together and taken a hidden treasure, while six Yak&#257;s were
dividing the articles one Yak&#257; having come to the house of that
man who went to plough, the Yak&#257; remained sitting down under the
bed at which is the pine-apple, in order to &ldquo;possess&rdquo; the
woman.</p>
<p>Then that man having ploughed came home. Having come there, sitting
down on the bed he said to the woman, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you cooked
yet? I have hunger [enough] to eat the Yak&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman said, &ldquo;I am still cooking. If you cannot wait
until the time [when I finish] there is [something] under the
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said it regarding the pine-apple. What of that! Because
she did not explain and say [so] the Yak&#257; thought, &ldquo;It is
regarding me, indeed, she said that;&rdquo; and the Yak&#257; having
become afraid, very quickly having arisen said to the man,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Don&rsquo;t eat me. Come along (<i>lit.</i>, come, to
go), for me to show you a place where there is a good hidden
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the man having got up from the bed and called the
man&rsquo;s younger brother, the two persons went with the Yak&#257;.
Having gone, they went to the place where those six Yak&#257;s are
dividing the articles.</p>
<p>Then the Yak&#257; said to the two men, &ldquo;Until the time when I
bring and give you the articles, there (<i lang="si-latn">onna</i>), go
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>that tree.&rdquo; After that, the two men went
into the tree to which the Yak&#257; told them to go.</p>
<p>Having gone there, while they are looking, six Yak&#257;s who had
great beards and the Yak&#257; who came summoning the men are
apportioning the articles. Then, having seen the bearded youngsters
(<i lang="si-latn">poll&#333;</i>), the elder became unconscious, and
fell from the tree to the ground.</p>
<p>Then the younger brother, being in the tree, said, &ldquo;Elder
brother, after you [have] jumped down seize the great-bearded youngster
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then because there are beards of the whole six, having said to each
other, &ldquo;It is for me, indeed, he said this; it is for me, indeed,
he said this,&rdquo; one by one, in the very order (<i>lit.</i>,
manner) in which they sprang up and went, the whole six Yak&#257;s,
having thrown down the articles, ran off. [Because] having been in the
tree that man said thus after the man&rsquo;s elder brother fell down,
those Yak&#257;s having said, &ldquo;He will come and kill us,&rdquo;
it was for that indeed the Yak&#257;s became afraid.</p>
<p>Well then, [the Yak&#257;] calling the men,&mdash;the elder brother
and younger brother,&mdash;and together with the men the Yak&#257;, the
very three persons, having drawn (carried) all the articles&mdash;both
the Yak&#257;&rsquo;s portion and the six portions of those six who ran
off&mdash;to that man&rsquo;s house, after they finished the Yak&#257;
went away. Those two men shared the articles.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a country, at the time when a Tom-tom Beater was
going to a devil-dance (<i lang="si-latn">kank&#257;riya</i>), it
became dark. While he was going along to the village in the dark, when
he was near the village having the devil-dance, to the extent of two
miles (<i lang="si-latn">haetaepma</i>) from it, he met with [an
adventure] in this manner.</p>
<p>In the adjoining village, a man having died they took his dead body
to the burning ground; and having raised a heap of firewood, and upon
it having placed the corpse and set fire to it, at the time when his
relatives went away in the evening Maha S&#333;n Yakshay&#257;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9619src" href="#xd27e9619" name="xd27e9619src">1</a>
came, and remained upon the burning funeral pyre. He said thus to the
Tom-tom Beater, it is said, &ldquo;Where art thou going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he asked it [he replied], &ldquo;I am going to a
devil-dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time when [the Yak&#257;] said, &ldquo;Standing there, beat
the [airs of] devil-dances, and the new ones that thou knowest,&rdquo;
he unfastened the tom-tom, and tying it (<i>i.e.</i>, slinging it from
his neck), he beat various dances.</p>
<p>The Yakshay&#257; being pleased at it, said thus, &ldquo;Do thou
look every day in the house in which are the looms.<a class="noteref"

<h2 class="main">How a Tom-tom Beater got a Marriage from a
Gamar&#257;la</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain time there was a Gamar&#257;la. The
Gamar&#257;la had a daughter. In the same country there was a very rich
Tom-tom Beater (<i lang="si-latn">Naekatiyek</i>). There was a son of
the Tom-tom Beater&rsquo;s. In order to make search for a marriage for
him he tramped through many countries. From those countries he did not
obtain one.</p>
<p>After that, he went to yet a country on the other side of a river.
Having gone there, when he looked about there was a Gamar&#257;la at a
village [who had a marriageable daughter]. When he asked for the
daughter [in marriage], he said he would not give her. Thereupon,
thinking and thinking of a scheme he acted accordingly, that is, in
this manner.</p>
<p>He caught an egret. He made a bundle of lights, and taking these he
went again to the village at which the Gamar&#257;la stayed. Having
gone [there], at the time when he looked about [he saw that] there was
a large betel creeper on a tree in front of the doorway of the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>After that, having come at night and gone up the tree, and hidden
himself so that he would not be seen, [after] lighting the bundle of
lights he called the Gamar&#257;la: &ldquo;Village Headman! Village
Headman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la having come running, looked upward, and
seeing that the bundle of lights were burning the Gamar&#257;la became
afraid.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Tom-tom Beater says, &ldquo;I, indeed, the
D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; of this village, am speaking. Wilt thou hearken
to what I am saying?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la, being afraid, said, &ldquo;I will
hearken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Tom-tom Beater called the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257;, [said],
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;They say that thou wilt not give thy daughter to the boy of
the Tom-tom Beater of such and such a village. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;Because our pollution rules (<i lang=
"si-latn">indul</i>) are different I said I cannot give her,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Then the Tom-tom Beater D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; who was in the tree
[said], &ldquo;Give thou thy daughter to him. On the seventh day from
now he will obtain the sovereignty. If thou shouldst not give [her] I
will kill thee.&rdquo; Tying the bundle of lights to the leg of the
egret, he said, &ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; and let the egret go.</p>
<p>Thereupon, having seen that the lights were burning on the leg of
the egret [as it flew away], the Gamar&#257;la thought that the
D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; said it.</p>
<p>Then the Tom-tom Beater, being invisible to everybody, descended
from the tree, and went to his village.</p>
<p>Two or three days afterwards, he came with the wedding party to the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house, for the purpose of taking away the
daughter. Thereupon, having eaten the [wedding] feast, on the morning
of the following day, because the giving of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s
daughter was demeaning he put her in a sack, and having tied it as a
bundle for carrying under a pole, [the Gamar&#257;la] gave her, placing
[the pole] on the shoulders of two persons, and telling them to go.
Then, lifting up the load, the party went away. Having gone thus, it
having become night they stayed near a tree.</p>
<p>At yet [another] city, the King of the city, having seized a bear
that ate human flesh, and put it in a sack, and tied it as a bundle for
carrying under a pole, gave it to two persons, and told them to take it
and throw it into the river.</p>
<p>At that time that party also came to the place where that [other]
party were staying. Thereupon, without speaking they placed the two
bundles in one spot. In the very same way again, without speaking they
were sleeping in one place.</p>
<p>On the morning of the following day, at dawn, the wedding party
having arisen went to the village, taking the bundle in which the bear
was tied.</p>
<p>The people who remained here unfastened the bag in order to put the
bear into the river. At that time [they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb298" href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>saw that] a Princess
was there. So the party having gone taking the Princess gave her to the
King. Then the King married that Queen.</p>
<p>The wedding party who went taking the bear bundle having gone to the
house, that very day, in order that the faults (<i lang=
"si-latn">d&#333;sa</i>) of the bride and bridegroom might go, drove
away any evil influence of the planets (<i lang=
"si-latn">baliyak</i>).</p>
<p>At that time, having put the sack and the bridegroom into a house
they shut and tied the door. Having tied it they conducted the service
[against the evil influence of the planets] in the open.</p>
<p>Thereupon the bridegroom who was inside the house unfastened the
sack in order to take out the bride. Then the bear having come out
began to bite the man. The bridegroom said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bite me!
Don&rsquo;t bite me!&rdquo; When he was saying it, the men who were
sending away the evil planetary influences said,
&ldquo;&#256;yib&#333;! &#256;yib&#333;!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9723src" href="#xd27e9723" name="xd27e9723src">1</a> The two who
were in the house remained without speaking any words [after that].</p>
<p>Thereupon it became light. These people having gone [there] opened
the door. Then the bear that ate men having sprung outside and bitten
the [would-be] mother-in-law, went into the midst of the forest. The
bridegroom, the bear having bitten him, died.</p>

<p class="first">There were a King and a Queen of a single city. The
two one day went for sport in the gardens. Then, sitting on a branch
there was a little bird.</p>
<p>At that time the Queen asked the King, &ldquo;Is that little bird
which is there the male or the female?&rdquo; The King said, &ldquo;The
male.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Queen, having said, &ldquo;It is not male; it is
female,&rdquo; made a wager. What was the wager, indeed? &ldquo;Let us
catch it and look. Should it be the cock I will not stay with you; I
will go away somewhere or other. Should it be the hen you must give me
the sovereignty,&rdquo; she said. Thereupon the King said, &ldquo;It is
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having caught the bird they looked; when they looked the animal was
the male.</p>
<p>Then the Queen said, &ldquo;I am going now,&rdquo; and she set
off.</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;We said it for fun, didn&rsquo;t we? Are you
going in that way for that little matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen would not [stay], &ldquo;I must really go,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the King having said, &ldquo;Are you going for that? We
made monkey fun.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9763src" href="#xd27e9763"
name="xd27e9763src">1</a> Owing to it where are you to go?&rdquo; said
much in the way of advice. Without hearkening to it the Queen went.
What was [the real reason of] it? [It was] because the royal talk was
Large.</p>
<p>When the Queen was going, the [completion of the] ten months of her
pregnancy was near; as she was going in a forest she bore a child.
Carrying the infant, as she was going along a path there was a river in
which the water had dried up. While she was going along the river the
Prince <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>began to cry. For the sake of stopping the
crying she picked up a stone which was on the ground in the river; and
having said, &ldquo;Look here, son,&rdquo; she stopped the crying, and
taking that little stone [with her] came to another city.</p>
<p>Having come [there] and walked to all places, and looked about, and
come to a house in which was a widow woman, she asked, &ldquo;Mother,
keeping this Prince for me, will you give me a little space to stay in,
until the time when the Prince becomes big?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the old woman said, &ldquo;It is good, daughter. I also am
alone; because of it remain here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen, having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; lived there,
pounding paddy [at houses] throughout the streets; and up to the time
when the Prince became big stayed there getting a living. By that time,
seven years of the Prince&rsquo;s age had passed.</p>
<p>While remaining [there] in this manner, one day the Prince said,
&ldquo;Mother, I am hungry,&rdquo; and cried. When he was crying, the
stone which his mother had brought that day from the river in order to
stop the Prince&rsquo;s [crying], had been thrown away into the open
ground in front of the house (<i lang="si-latn">midula</i>).</p>
<p>This woman, having shown him the stone, said falsely, &ldquo;Look
there. Take that stone which is there, and having given it at the
bazaar, and eaten rice cakes, come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince, having gone running, taking that stone, begged
throughout the whole of the bazaar, &ldquo;An&#275;! Take this stone
and give me rice cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men said to that Prince, &ldquo;Who gives rice cakes for quartz
stones, Bola?&rdquo; and scolded him at each place to which he
went.</p>
<p>After that, the Prince, having asked at every place without
[obtaining any cakes], went to the King&rsquo;s palace also, at the
time when the King was walking at the Audience Hall, and said,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Take this stone, and give me rice cakes; I am
hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the King, having heard the sweet speech of this young
Prince, becoming pleased, said, &ldquo;Where, Bola, is the stone? Bring
it here for me to look at it.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Prince took the stone, and gave it into the King&rsquo;s hand.
The King taking the stone in his hand, when he looked at it, it was a
gem-stone. Then the King asked, &ldquo;Bola, whence [came] this stone
to thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This stone was in the open ground at the front of the house.
Mother said to me, &lsquo;Take it, and having eaten rice cakes, come
back.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;I will give thee rice cakes. Go and tell
thy mother to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince having gone running home, said, &ldquo;Mother, a man said
that you are to come, [so that he may] give rice cakes to me. The man,
taking the stone, too, put it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen, walking with the Prince, said, &ldquo;Which is the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;There, that house,&rdquo; the Prince stretched
out his hand towards the royal palace.</p>
<p>With the thoughts, &ldquo;I shall be worn away with fear, I shall be
worn away. An&#275;! The thing that this foolish boy has done! Having
said that he gave him a quartz stone, the King, in order to appoint
[the punishment for] his fault, told me to come here,&rdquo; she
reached the royal palace.</p>
<p>Thereupon the King having seen her, becoming much pleased, asked,
&ldquo;Whence didst thou obtain this stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Queen began to tell him everything,&mdash;the way in which
she made the bet with that King, the way in which she came away, the
way in which she bore [a child], the way in which while coming, she
stopped the [crying of the] Prince by picking up this stone from the
river.</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;This is a gem-stone. Putting me [out of
consideration], having appointed any person you like, he cannot state
the value of this. I have not got even wealth [sufficient] to give for
this. Because of it, having given to thee the wealth, too, thou hast
not a place to put it in. Therefore stay ye in my palace itself until
the Prince, having become big, marries a Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having made ready and given them a good room, and given them the
royal victuals, he made the two remain there.</p>
<p>While they are staying there, having prepared two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>bracelets for the King&rsquo;s Queen, because
there was not a stone more to [match] that stone for fixing in the two
bracelets, he asked the Queen who gave the stone, &ldquo;Canst thou
find and bring a stone more, like this stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen said, &ldquo;I cannot go. If there be still [any] in the
river, or what, I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Queen&rsquo;s Prince said to the King, &ldquo;I
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King asked, &ldquo;Do you know the path to go on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I will ask mother, and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;What is necessary for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince [said], &ldquo;From those that are in your stable be good
enough to give me a horse which goes on hard journeys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King gave the Prince the horse with the best qualities of
all, a sword, and a bundle of cooked rice. The Prince would be about
fifteen years of age.</p>
<p>The Prince, having mounted on the horse, asked his mother,
&ldquo;Mother, on which hand is the river in which you picked up the
stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen said, &ldquo;It is this hand,&rdquo; and stretched out her
hand. Then driving the horse to that hand he began to go.</p>
<p>Having gone away, and stopped at a river near that [gem] river, when
he looked about, at a great rough tree [what was] like a large fire was
visible. Then this Prince, in order to look at the conflagration, went
near the tree. Having gone [there], when he looked a
D&#275;vat&#257;-daughter endowed with much beauty<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e9843src" href="#xd27e9843" name="xd27e9843src">2</a> was
there.</p>
<p>Then this Prince asked the D&#275;vat&#257;-daughter, &ldquo;Who art
thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;I am a Yaksan&#299;.&rdquo; Then the
Yaksan&#299; asked the Prince, &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I am a royal Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this Prince became mentally inclined towards the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>very
beautiful Yaksan&#299;; the Yaksan&#299; also became mentally inclined
towards the Prince.</p>
<p>The Yaksan&#299; asked the Prince, &ldquo;Where are you going,
Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I came to seek a gem-stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Yaksan&#299; said, &ldquo;We indeed remain in charge of
this gem river. Should the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; Unnaehae come he
will kill you. It is I indeed they call the Gem Goddess. I can give
gems. [After] marrying me and placing me on the horse, if you should
not go twelve y&#333;janas<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9866src" href=
"#xd27e9866" name="xd27e9866src">3</a> before half a paeya (of
twenty-four minutes) has gone, the Gem D&#275;vat&#257;
Unnaehae<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9875src" href="#xd27e9875" name=
"xd27e9875src">4</a> will come and behead both of us, and burn
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince being pleased at it (that is, her proposal), said,
&ldquo;It is good&rdquo;, and placing the Princess on the back of the
horse, asked, &ldquo;Where are the gems?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The D&#275;vat&#257;-daughter said, &ldquo;I will give them; I have
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he drove away the horse twelve y&#333;janas before half a paeya
[had passed]. Having driven it, when he went to the city the King asked
the Prince, &ldquo;Have you brought the gems?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Yaksan&#299; had previously<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9888src"
href="#xd27e9888" name="xd27e9888src">5</a> said at the hand of the
Prince that when the King asks, &ldquo;Have you brought the
gems?&rdquo; he is to say, &ldquo;I have brought [them].&rdquo; Because
of it, the Prince said, &ldquo;I have brought the gems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;Where? Let me look at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time the D&#275;vat&#257;-daughter said, &ldquo;They will be
outside,&rdquo; and threw down in the open space in front of the palace
a gobbet<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9900src" href="#xd27e9900" name=
"xd27e9900src">6</a> of saliva. When the King looked it was as though a
rain of gems had rained.</p>
<p>After that, the King, picking up the gems, went to the palace, and
remained lying down without eating and drinking. The Minister having
come, asked, &ldquo;O Lord, what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;The Prince who gave the gem has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>brought the Gem Princess. If I haven&rsquo;t the
Princess what are these Gods for? What is this sovereignty
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minister said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you, Sir, be troubled about
it; I will tell you a stratagem for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King asked, &ldquo;What is the stratagem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minister said, &ldquo;The stratagem indeed is in this
manner:&mdash;You, Sir, be good enough to say to the Prince,
&lsquo;Dear Prince, our mother and father died. Those persons are
staying in the God-world. Canst thou [go there and after] looking [at
their condition] come back?&rsquo; Then the Prince through not
understanding will say, &lsquo;I can.&rsquo; Then, having summoned all
them of the city and having cut an underground tunnel about a mile
(<i lang="si-latn">haetaekma</i>) deep (that is, in length), when you
have told him to go by that way to the God-world, he will go. Then
having put a stone on [the entrance to] it, and brought tusk elephants,
and made them trample on it, you can take the Gem Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King having become pleased at the word, caused the Prince to be
brought, and asked, &ldquo;Dear Prince, canst thou go to the God-world
in three weeks&rsquo; [time, to inquire after our father and mother],
and come back?&rdquo; The Prince said, &ldquo;I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King having collected together the men of the city, and
said falsely that he is cutting a path to go to the God-world, began to
cause a tunnel to be cut, in order to kill the Prince.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince said to the Gem Princess, &ldquo;In this manner
the King asked me: &lsquo;Can you go to the God-world and come
back?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I can.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, owing to the wisdom of the Gem Princess she perceived that he
is making the plan (<i lang="si-latn">s&#363;ttar&#275;</i>) to kill
this Prince, and said, &ldquo;Why, through foolishness did you, Sir,
say you can? Since you said you can, [you must do as
follows]:&mdash;Under the gem river an elder sister of ours is rearing
rats. Having gone, and given her this ring of mine, be good enough to
say, &lsquo;In such and such a city your younger sister is living. She
said [you are] to send there two or three thousand rats.&rsquo; Then
she will send the rats. You [then] be good enough to come back,
Sir.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Prince went, and having given her the ring, and told her in that
very manner, the elder sister of the Gem Princess then said, &ldquo;It
is good; I will send them. You, Sir, be good enough to go.&rdquo; Then
he came back.</p>
<p>That day night, having started them off, she sent three thousand
rats. The rats having come before the light fell, went to the room in
which was the Gem Princess. At the time when they went, she gave food
and drink to the rats, and said, &ldquo;Before a week has gone they
will cut the tunnel which the King is cutting, a mile deep. Because of
it, you must cut [a path from here leading] into that tunnel at a mile
from this room in which we are staying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they cut and finished both tunnels on one day. Regarding the
tunnel which the rats cut, the King was unable to learn even a little
bit. Without making the tunnel which the rats cut break into and become
part of<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9940src" href="#xd27e9940" name=
"xd27e9940src">7</a> the King&rsquo;s tunnel, they turned it a little
across [towards it at the end].</p>
<p>After that, having cut the [other] tunnel and finished it, and given
the Prince a horse, and given him a sword, the King said, &ldquo;Look
here. We have cleared the path to go to the God-world. Having gone,
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;It is good.&rdquo; Having said it, and
gone near the Gem Princess, at the time when he was saying, &ldquo;I
will go, and come,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9955src" href=
"#xd27e9955" name="xd27e9955src">8</a> the Princess said, &ldquo;Say to
the King that you will come in a week; and go,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Then the Prince having told the King, &ldquo;I shall come in a
week,&rdquo; went. Having driven the horse into that tunnel which the
King cut, and gone along the tunnel, and come to the other tunnel
[excavated by the rats], during the daytime he stays in the tunnel. At
night, having come near the Gem Princess, and eaten rice, and been
sleeping, again as the light falls he goes to the tunnel and remains
[there].</p>
<p>At the time when the Prince sprang into that tunnel, men threw
stones into the tunnel, and heaped them up. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>They
do not know the fact that that Prince is staying in the tunnel which
the rats cut.</p>
<p>After that, the King came, and spoke to the Princess, &ldquo;Now
then, let us two be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princess said, &ldquo;I will not. My husband has said that
he will come in a week. Because of it, until he comes I will not marry
any one whatever. If he come not I will marry,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The King having heard that word [said], &ldquo;It is good. After a
week has gone I will marry [you].&rdquo; Thinking, &ldquo;The Prince
having been put into the tunnel, and stones trampled down [over it],
when will he come again? That Princess, the Prince not [being here], in
perplexity at his death is talking nonsense,&rdquo; he went away.</p>
<p>What does the Princess do? Having taken gem-stones to the extent of
many millions (in value), she caused to be sewn a diadem-wreath
(<i lang="si-latn">o&#7789;unu m&#257;l&#257;wak</i>), and a dress.
Having sewn them, at early dawn (<i lang="si-latn">r&#257;e
p&#257;ndara</i>) of the day following the week, having dressed this
Prince, she said, &ldquo;As the light is falling, having waited behind
the King&rsquo;s palace be good enough to come as though
returning,&rdquo; and sent him [there].</p>
<p>Thereupon, the Prince in that manner at the time when the King
arises in the morning, presented himself for the King&rsquo;s
cognizance (<i lang="si-latn">indiriya&#7789;a</i>). Then the
King,&mdash;after becoming afraid concerning the return of the Prince
whom he had put in the tunnel in which he had placed stones, and having
employed tusk elephants had trampled them down,&mdash;asked,
&ldquo;Prince, whence camest thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince said, &ldquo;O Lord, Your Majesty, your father
the King and mother the Queen, also, are staying in happiness in the
God-world. I went there. Having said my dress was bad (<i lang=
"si-latn">n&#257;kayi</i>) they gave me, for wearing, a dress which,
those persons having worn it, had become old,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>When the King looked in the direction of his dress [he thought that]
except that in the God-world [there might be] such a dress, it is of
the kind which is not in this world. Because of it, it seemed to the
King to be true.</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;The party said that you also, Sir, are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>to go. They tried not to permit me, also, to
come back. Having said, &lsquo;I will come back,&rsquo; for the purpose
of what I am saying to you I returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I went in the tunnel and looked about yet [another] path
[leading] there had been cleared. Having gone on that path, when I
looked the God-world was quite near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King, having collected the citizens, began to remove
the earth at that tunnel which he cut to kill the Prince.</p>
<p>Having heard of it, that Prince in order that the tunnel which the
rats had cut should be closed, told the rats, and again made them push
back the earth.</p>
<p>Having pushed it back, while he is staying [there], on the following
day the King alone went, and having said, &ldquo;[After] looking [at
the God-world] I shall return,&rdquo; went off.</p>
<p>When he is descending into the hole to go, what does this Prince do?
Having thrown down those stones that had been taken out, and blocked up
the tunnel so as not to allow the King to return, the King died in the
tunnel.</p>
<p>After that, this Prince, having seized and beheaded the Minister who
had told [the King] the stratagem for the purpose of killing him,
summoned the whole of the citizens, and said to the people, &ldquo;For
the offence which the King committed against me I put the King into the
tunnel, and killed him. From to-day the King of this city is I
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Thereafter] exercising the sovereignty, marrying the Gem Princess,
and establishing that King&rsquo;s Queen as a female servant, he
remained there.</p>

<p class="first">In <i>Sagas from the Far East</i>, p. 97, in a Kalmuk
story a painter who was jealous of a wood-carver presented to the Khan
a pretended note from his dead father, requesting that the carver might
be sent to the kingdom of the Gods, and stating that the painter would
show the way. The painter explained that the carver must be burnt in a
pyre, with much drum beating, and rise to heaven on a horse through the
clouds of smoke. The carver escaped by a tunnel <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>which his wife excavated to the centre of the
pyre, getting into it while the timber by which he was surrounded was
burning. After a month he gave the Khan a letter from his father in
heaven, ordering him to reward the carver richly, and to send the
painter to decorate the temple which had been built. The painter was
thus killed in the way he designed for the carver&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>There is a variant in the Sierra Leone country, given in <i>Cunnie
Rabbit</i>, etc. (Cronise and Ward), p. 254. As advised by a messenger,
a King who wished to kill his son told him that he should be King, and
that in order to be crowned he must be tied in a mat, thrown into a
deep pool, and left there three days. When the party halted on the way
and left the bundle on the path for a time, the youth got a child to
unfasten the package, and inserted a large stone which was afterwards
duly thrown into the water. After three days the youth made his
appearance wearing a crown and riding a horse. He was acclaimed as
King, and he stated that he had been ordered to send his father&rsquo;s
messenger to be crowned in the same way. He was seized, tied up, and
drowned. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=

<p class="first">In a certain country there is a King, and the King has
three children, males. On the second p&#333;ya day (the full-moon day),
at the time when the moon has risen, having caused these three Princes
to be brought, he asked, &ldquo;Son, what is this moon good
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big son said, &ldquo;This moon is good for [enabling] poor
people to go on journeys; it is good for trampling stacks (threshing by
means of buffaloes).&rdquo; The King accepted this word.</p>
<p>He asked at the hand of the next (<i lang="si-latn">ekkama</i>) son;
that son replied in that very manner.</p>
<p>He asked at the hand of the next son. That son said, &ldquo;It is
good for [enabling] the M&#299;-flower<a class="noteref" id=

keep.&rdquo;</p>

be brought, he started off the youngest Prince and the two elder
Princes and the executioner, these four persons. He told him to behead
the Prince.</p>
<p>At the time when these four were going in the midst of the jungle,
there was a Banyan-tree; the four persons sat down in the shade under

"si-latn">ka&#7789;uss&#257;</i>) and smearing the blood on the sword,
came and told the King, &ldquo;I beheaded him.&rdquo; The King took it
for the fact.</p>
<p>The Prince having arisen, when he looked about, his two elder
brothers were not [there], and the executioner was not [there]. Because
there was not a place to go to he went to sleep again under that very
Banyan-tree.</p>
<p>Having arisen in the morning, when he looked there was no water, no
food. Having climbed up the tree, he saw that water was pouring down at
the margin of a rocky hill. He descended from the Banyan-tree, and went
along looking constantly at the hill. Taking a little water [at it],
and washing his face, at the time when he was going up the hill a bee
came, and turned (flew) round his head; then he struck at the bee. A
second time having come it turned round his head; a second time he
struck at it. Having come even the third time, when it was turning
round his head he thought, &ldquo;I must look for [the hive of]
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the hill there were rocks. Having come [and found the hive],
sitting down at them he drew out the comb. Having drawn it out, when he
looked in the hive (<i lang="si-latn">m&#299;ya</i>) there was an
ash-pumpkin [flower]. He took out the ash-pumpkin [flower], and when he
looked in it there was a Princess.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10073src"
href="#xd27e10073" name="xd27e10073src">4</a> Having gone away, taking
the Princess also, after sitting down under a N&#257;-tree and looking
and looking around, eating and eating the honey he gave to the Princess
also. This Princess in a day or two became big.</p>
<p>Beneath that very N&#257;-tree they stayed for three days. While one
day sitting below the same N&#257;-tree, when he looked upward in the
N&#257;-tree there was a large flower, a kind of ash-pumpkin [flower],
in the N&#257;-tree. He went up the tree for that flower also, and
plucking the flower descended. After having thrown away the petals,
when he looked [inside] there was a Princess. He gave honey to the
Princess, and they remained under the same N&#257;-tree. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span></p>
<p>After four days they set out from beneath the N&#257;-tree. In a day
or two these two Princesses were [as big as though their age was]
twelve years. Having gone along in the jungle, they came out at a
certain country, and went to the house of a widow-Mahag&#275; (an old
woman of good connections), and stayed there. The widow-Mahag&#275;
eats by pounding paddy at the King&rsquo;s house and being given the
rice-dust. She gave [some] to these three persons also; the two
Princesses and the Prince were unable to eat it, they said.</p>
<p>At that time the widow-Mahag&#275; having gone near the King says,
&ldquo;O King, Your Majesty, at the place where I live, two Princesses
and a Prince having come thus, are staying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the King says, &ldquo;Widow-Mahag&#275;, wilt thou tell
the Prince to come to my palace?&rdquo; he said. The Mahag&#275; having
come, told him.</p>
<p>At the time when she is telling him, the Princesses say,
&ldquo;Should he tell you any work, don&rsquo;t say,
&lsquo;H&#257;&rsquo; (yes), and don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;I
cannot,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10094src" href="#xd27e10094"
name="xd27e10094src">5</a> and don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;I can.&rsquo;
Having said, &lsquo;After having considered I will tell you,&rsquo;
come back,&rdquo; the Princesses say.</p>
<p>To the M&#299;-flower Princess the chariot of the Gods is visible
beyond a kalpa; to the N&#257;-flower Princess the chariot of the Gods
is visible beyond two kalpas.</p>
<p>[When he went to the palace], &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; the King says to
the Prince, &ldquo;in the morning and in the evening I want seven
handkerchiefs of Blue-lotus flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not say &ldquo;H&#257;&rdquo;; he did not say &ldquo;I
cannot.&rdquo; After having said, &ldquo;I will consider and tell
you,&rdquo; he came back to the place where he is living at the
widow&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>This Prince having come, says to the two Princesses, &ldquo;The King
says to me, &lsquo;In the morning and in the evening I want seven and
seven handkerchiefs of [Blue-lotus] flowers. Can you [bring
them]?&rsquo; Thereupon I said, &lsquo;After having considered I will
tell you.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princesses say, &ldquo;Prince, when you have gone to pluck the
flowers you would die while in the pool, [but we <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>will
save you]. In the pool there is a great Crocodile. Because the King is
not clever [enough] to kill you and write (that is, contract) a
marriage to us two, it is good to do thus,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the Prince having gone the second time near the King,
this Prince says, &ldquo;I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he came home taking seven handkerchiefs, both the Princesses,
having called the Prince and having combed and tied up his hair
(<i>lit.</i>, head), uttered spells on his right over a handful of
sand, and after giving it, say, &ldquo;Having gone near the pool, throw
down the handful of sand on the right. At that time the
human-flesh-eating Crocodile having come will go ashore.&rdquo; Having
given [the spells over] a handful on the left also, they said,
&ldquo;Plucking seven handkerchiefs of flowers, come out, and quickly
on the left throw down this handful of sand, [or] the Crocodile will
come.&rdquo; [He acted accordingly.]</p>
<p>At the time when he was coming [after] plucking the flowers, a large
Blue-lotus flower having been there he plucked that flower, and having
come back, gave it [to the Princesses] at the house. Then having gone
to the royal palace, taking also the seven handkerchiefs of flowers,
[he gave them to the King].</p>
<p>Quickly having come back, taking the [Blue-lotus] flower at the
house into his hand, and having cast away the petals, when he looked
there was a Princess.</p>
<p>At that time the widow-Mahag&#275; having gone to the royal house,
says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if this Prince is a magician;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10125src" href="#xd27e10125" name=
"xd27e10125src">6</a> I don&rsquo;t know if he is a person possessed of
supernatural powers;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10129src" href=
"#xd27e10129" name="xd27e10129src">7</a> I cannot find out what he is.
Now he is there, and three Princesses are there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King thinks, &ldquo;How [am I] to take these very three
beautiful Princesses?&rdquo; he thinks. Again he thinks, &ldquo;Should
I send this Prince to the N&#257;ga world I can take them; without it,
indeed, I cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time the King says to the widow-Mahag&#275;, &ldquo;Say thou
to the Prince that I say he is to come.&rdquo; She accepted that word;
having come she told the Prince. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313"
href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the time when she is saying it, the Blue-lotus-flower Princess
says to the Prince, &ldquo;Prince, should he tell you any work,
don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;H&#257;&rsquo;; don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;I
cannot&rsquo;; don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;I can.&rsquo; Having gone to the
royal palace, when he has said it come back, saying, &lsquo;After I
have considered I will tell you.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having gone and returned, he says to these three Princesses,
&ldquo;The King says thus to me, &lsquo;How is it? Canst thou go to the
N&#257;ga world?&rsquo; he says. Thereupon I said, &lsquo;Having
considered I will tell you.&rsquo; Having said [this] I came
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then these three Princesses say, &ldquo;Prince, when [he thinks] you
have died the King will come summoning us three to go [to become his
wives].&rdquo; These Princesses say to the Prince, &ldquo;You go [to
the King]. Having gone, say, &lsquo;I can.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He having gone, and having returned after saying it, they thereupon
summoned the Prince. Sitting near him, the M&#299;-flower Princess,
taking a palmful of oil, after having uttered spells over it rubbed it
on his head. The N&#257;-flower Princess also having uttered spells
over oil rubbed [it on his head]. The Blue-lotus-flower Princess also
having uttered spells over oil rubbed [it on his head].</p>
<p>The M&#299;-flower Princess next having uttered spells over a
handful of sand, gave it into his hand. The N&#257;-flower Princess
also having uttered spells [over sand] gave it into his hand, and told
him to tie it himself at his waist. The Blue-lotus-flower Princess also
having uttered spells over a handful of sand, said, &ldquo;Having gone
near the tunnel [leading to the N&#257;ga world], when just going into
the hole throw down the sand of the M&#299;-flower Princess. At the
time when you are descending and going down the hole, when going to the
middle of the hole throw down the sand of the N&#257;-flower Princess.
When going to the foot of the tunnel, throw down the sand of the
Blue-lotus-flower Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having stayed at the house of the widow-Mahag&#275;, they cut a
tunnel [which met the tunnel opened by the King, so that the Prince
might escape by it]. The Prince does not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb314" href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>go; the
widow-Mahag&#275; does not know [about it]. Anyone you like<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10153src" href="#xd27e10153" name=
"xd27e10153src">8</a> [sees it] not; they do not know [about it].</p>
<p>[On the appointed day] having gone into the tunnel at the
King&rsquo;s <i lang="si-latn">midula</i> (the open space in front of
the palace), at the time when he is coming to this tunnel, the King,
having blocked up the King&rsquo;s tunnel and having employed elephants
and trampled [the earth down], and having come, says to the three
Princesses, &ldquo;Princesses, go ye to the royal palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time these three say, &ldquo;When our Prince has gone three
months, and three p&#333;yas (at the quarters of the moon), and three
days, and three half days, should he not return we will come. You, Sir,
be good enough to go.&rdquo; Thereupon the King went back to the
palace.</p>
<p>[While he was there, the Prince, who had escaped by the secret
tunnel, proceeded to the palace to see him.] Having [stated that he
had] gone to the N&#257;ga world and come back, the Prince says to the
King, &ldquo;O King, Your Majesty&rsquo;s father, the [late] King, has
arrived at old age; he says to you that you also are to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time, [as he believed this], having removed the stones and
earth [that he had placed] in the tunnel down which the Prince went,
the King also began to go. Having handed over the sovereignty to the
Crown and the Sword [of State], and gone near the tunnel, and summoned
everybody (<i lang="si-latn">s&#275;ro&#7789;&#333;ma</i>), he says,
&ldquo;Having handed over the sovereignty to the Crown and the Sword, I
am going. When I have gone for the space (<i lang="si-latn">taena</i>)
of three months and three p&#333;yas, I shall come back. Until the time
when I come be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the very time when he is descending into the tunnel, they brought
elephants, and having put stones and earth in it, when they trampled
them down the King died.</p>
<p>Three p&#333;yas and three days and three months went by. He came
not ever.</p>
<p>As the sovereignty was going to be lost, loading on the tusk
elephant&rsquo;s back the robes and the Crown and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>Sword, and having made notification by tom-toms,
at the time when it is walking in the street the M&#299;-flower
Princess, and N&#257;-flower Princess, and Blue-lotus-flower Princess
say to the Prince, &ldquo;To-day you, Sir, will obtain the sovereignty.
Do not go anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince says, &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These three say, &ldquo;Now, now, you will obtain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tusk elephant having come, when it was making obeisance by
kneeling he mounted on the tusk elephant, and putting on the Crown and
taking the Sword in his hand, he went to the palace.</p>
<p>For the dead King there were five hundred Princesses. Having
separated them in a different house, he allowed the five hundred to be
[there]. Thereafter, after building separate houses for the
M&#299;-flower Princess, and for the N&#257;-flower Princess, and for
the Blue-lotus-flower Princess, he sent them to them.</p>
<p>At the time when he was exercising the sovereignty in that manner,
the country of his parents who told [the executioner] to behead this
one, became abandoned. When this King was on the floor of the upper
story, while this one&rsquo;s elder elder brother, taking a bundle of
firewood [for sale], was going through the midst of the city, the King
saw him. Having called him, and after he had thrown down the bundle of
firewood having summoned him to come here, this King says, &ldquo;There
is not permission for yourself to come again to this city,&rdquo; and
he sent away this one.</p>
<p>At the next occasion, on the second day, at the time when the
younger elder brother was coming, taking a pingo (carrying-stick) load
of Jak [fruit], the King tells this one also. Calling him near he says,
&ldquo;Why hast thou brought Jak? Has thy city become waste, or what?
Why is it?&rdquo; he asks at the hand of this man who brought Jak.</p>
<p>At that time this one says, &ldquo;Our country having become waste,
there is much scarcity of food to eat, for our King and
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon this King says, &ldquo;Canst thou come here with the three
persons (his parents and other brother)?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This one says, &ldquo;An&#275;! O Lord; send us two, for us to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>come with those two.&rdquo; Thereupon the King,
having been troubled [at the news], sent the two persons.</p>
<p>These two having gone, say to this one&rsquo;s two parents,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Father-King, that King says that we four
persons&mdash;between that city and this city there is a
river&mdash;having <span class="corr" id="xd27e10206" title=
"Source: came">come</span> to the river he says we are to remain
[there].&rdquo; Thereupon, because there was no food for the four
persons, and because they could not endure the hunger, on the second
p&#333;ya day, at the time when the moon had risen they came to the
river, and stayed there.</p>
<p>Thereupon the King, and the M&#299;-flower Princess, and the
N&#257;-flower Princess, and the Blue-lotus-flower Princess, sitting on
the chariot, went near the river. Having seen these four persons, and
descended from the chariot, he told that party of four persons to
ascend the chariot.</p>
<p>Then the four persons say, &ldquo;An&#275;! We cannot mount on this.
Whether you, Sir, [are going] to behead<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10213src" href="#xd27e10213" name="xd27e10213src">9</a> us, or
chop us [in pieces],<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10217src" href=
"#xd27e10217" name="xd27e10217src">10</a> or kill us [in some other
way], we do not know. We cannot mount on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making them mount by harassing them and combating [their
objections],<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10223src" href="#xd27e10223"
name="xd27e10223src">11</a> they came to the palace. Having come to the
palace, after having given them a separate house to live in, and given
them expenses for food, he said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be afraid; you
remain [here],&rdquo; this King says to these four persons.</p>
<p>At the time when a long period had gone by in this manner, the King
thought that with the four persons he must eat food at one table.
Having thought so, after three or four months he sent four men to the
four persons, and having caused them to bathe, and [then] caused them
to bathe in coconut milk scented with sandal-wood,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e10229src" href="#xd27e10229" name="xd27e10229src">12</a> and
given to all the four persons four pairs of vestments that
day,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10233src" href="#xd27e10233" name=
"xd27e10233src">13</a> he told [the servants] to send food [for all] to
eat at one table.</p>
<p>They having sent the food [and] table, and the four persons sitting
down together with the M&#299;-flower, the N&#257;-flower, the
Blue-lotus-flower Princesses, at the time when he tells them to eat the
cooked rice the four say, &ldquo;An&#275;! <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>We
cannot eat at one table with you, Sir. How can you, Sir, a King, and
we, eat [together]?&rdquo; these four persons say.</p>
<p>The King says, &ldquo;Nothing will happen through your eating at one
table with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time when, through [his] harassing them and combating [their
objections],<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10246src" href="#xd27e10246"
name="xd27e10246src">14</a> they are eating [after] having sat down at
one table, the King asks, &ldquo;Can you, or cannot you recognise
me?&rdquo; the King asks.</p>
<p>Thereupon the four persons say, &ldquo;An&#275;! We cannot recognise
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time when they have said and said [this], three drops of milk
having come from the breast of his mother fell on the King&rsquo;s
face.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10254src" href="#xd27e10254" name=
"xd27e10254src">15</a> When they fell she began to weep.</p>
<p>Thereupon the King says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry. The thing I said
became correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time the King [his father] becoming afraid and terrified, he
said, &ldquo;Father-King, here, behold! the M&#299;-flower Princess.
Here, behold! the N&#257;-flower Princess. Here, behold! the
Blue-lotus-flower Princess,&rdquo; and showed them.</p>
<p>Then the King says, &ldquo;Are you willing to take the sovereignty
of the city?&rdquo; he asked at the hand of the King&rsquo;s father.
&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>To his father he gave the sovereignty. To the elder brother he gave
the Ministership (<i lang="si-latn">aemaetkoma</i>); he appointed the
[second] Ministership for the younger elder brother. &ldquo;Now
then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when we have gone you will not give us a
little betel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this story is [related] the manner in which a foolish King,
taking the sovereignty, without considering exercised the
sovereignty.</p>

like to do. The elders expressed good wishes, but the youngest stated
that he would like to spend the fine moonlight in a beautiful house
with lovely girls. The father turned him out for saying this, and he
had various adventures unlike those of this Sinhalese story.</p>
<p>In the same work, vol. xxvi, p. 109, in a Telugu story by G. R.
Subramiah Pantulu, Divijak&#299;rtti, King of
Chol&#803;ama&#7751;&#7693;ala, had three sons, of each one of whom he
inquired what he most desired. The first wished to be surrounded by
learned men and to study the great Indian Epics and sacred books, the
second wished to obtain wealth and visit sacred shrines, the third
wanted to acquire a kingdom and gain a good reputation by making it
prosperous. The King made over the sovereignty to the third one, giving
the first one villages and the second one money to go on a
pilgrimage.</p>
<p>In <i>The J&#257;taka</i>, No. 96 (vol. i, p. 234), the
B&#333;dhisatta received a charmed thread and some charmed sand from
Pacc&#275;ka Buddhas as safe-guards on a journey. These preserved him,
the sand placed on his head and the thread twisted round his brow, from
an Ogress (R&#257;kshas&#299;) who, with others, devoured all in the
palace.</p>
<p>In <i>The J&#257;taka</i>, No. 380 (vol. iii, p. 161) a &ldquo;being
of perfect merit&rdquo; fell from &#346;akra&rsquo;s heaven, and was
re-born as a girl inside a lotus flower. &ldquo;When the other lotuses
grew old and fell, that one grew great and stood.&rdquo; An ascetic
opened it, found the girl inside, and reared her. &#346;akra created a
crystal palace for her, provided her with divine clothing and food, and
in the end the King of Benares married her.</p>
<p>In <i>The Story of Madana K&#257;ma R&#257;ja</i>
(Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;), p. 81, when a King of
Udayagiri one moonlight night asked his seven sons what they would like
to be doing, the first suggested leading an army into an enemy&rsquo;s
country, the second wished to be irrigating some land, the third wished
to be ploughing, the fourth to be walking from one village to another,
the fifth to be hunting, the sixth to be a cooly. The seventh son
wished to be the sole Emperor of the world, reclining on a couch,
attended by four wives, the daughters of Indra, Agni, Varu&#7751;a, and
&#256;di&#347;&#275;sha (the serpent-king). His mother, hearing that he
was to be executed for this wish, sent him away secretly with a bag of
money. Next morning the executioners showed the blood of an animal as
that of the Prince. The Prince acquired the wished-for wives, induced a
King who tried to kill him, to jump into a fire from which he himself
had come successfully by Agni&rsquo;s aid, and became King of a magic
city. In the meantime his father had been driven out of Udayagiri, and
with his wife and other sons got a living by selling firewood. The
young King recognised them, gave the sovereignty to his father, and
himself took the post of Minister. He had further adventures
afterwards.</p>
<p>There are several Indian accounts of girls who made their appearance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>out of fruits or flowers, and one of a Prince,
in addition to the deity in the tale numbered 153, and the sons of King
S&#257;gara, mentioned in the note after it. In one old legend the
Goddess Pattin&#299; in one incarnation was produced from a Mango
fruit, and in another from a Blue-lotus flower.</p>
<p>In <i>Old Deccan Days</i> (M. Frere), p. 96, a girl was found inside
a Mango fruit.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Fairy Tales</i> (M. Stokes), p. 11, a Prince and
Princess who had been killed came to life afresh inside two fruits
produced on a tree which grew at the spot where their livers had been
thrown. At p. 81 a Princess reappeared full-grown inside a fruit in a
King&rsquo;s garden. At p. 138, there is an account of a Princess who
issued full-grown from a B&#275;l fruit (<i lang="la">&AElig;gle
marmelos</i>). After being drowned she became a Pink-lotus flower, and
when this was destroyed she reappeared as an infant inside a B&#275;l
fruit.</p>
<p>In the Kolh&#257;n tales (Bompas) appended to <i>Folklore of the
Santal Parganas</i>, p. 461, there is a story of this type regarding a
Princess who was in a B&#275;l fruit.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. ii, p. 142, a tear of joy fell from the eye of a Vidy&#257;dhara
maiden on a Jambu flower, and a fruit was produced; when it fell and
broke open a heavenly maiden came out of it, and was reared by a
hermit.</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol.
iii, p. 327, a Buddhist nun, Amrap&#257;li, related an account of her
previous births during ninety-one kalpas, from mango flowers. The
details of her last birth are given; she became the mother of the
celebrated physician J&#299;vaka, the son of King Bimbis&#257;ra, and
afterwards took the religious vows. Professor Chavannes states that the
work in which this story occurs was translated into Chinese between
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 148 and 170.</p>
<p>In the same volume, p. 337, there is a story of the birth of two
other girls from flowers, one from a Suman&#257; flower and the other
from a Blue lotus.</p>
<p>In <i>Korean Tales</i> (Dr. H. N. Allen), p. 164, a girl who had
drowned herself to appease an evil spirit who refused to allow the
passage of some boats, was sent back to life in a large flower on a
plant floating on the sea. A King who preserved the flower saw her when
she emerged at night, and married her.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata</i> (<i lang=
"sa-latn">Va&#7751;a Parva</i>, cxlvi ff.) Bhimas&#275;na, one of the
P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava Princes, went in search of golden lotus
flowers, and found them in a lake at the Gandham&#257;dana mountain,
belonging to Kuv&#275;ra, the God of Wealth.</p>
<p>In <i>Reynard the Fox in Southern Africa</i> (Dr. Bleek), p. 55, a
girl appeared out of a calabash in which a woman had placed her
daughter&rsquo;s heart after it had been recovered from the body of a
lion that had eaten her. The woman put with it the first milk of the
cows which calved. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320"

(Variant <i>a</i>.)</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a King and a Queen, it
is said. There is an only Prince of the Queen&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The King was stricken by a very great scarcity (<i lang=
"si-latn">s&#257;yak</i>). Well then, the Queen and the King and the
Prince devoured (plundered) all the things and pansalas (monks&rsquo;
residences) that were in the city. Having devoured them, on the day
when they were finished the King said at the hand of the Queen,
&ldquo;To-morrow I must behead our Prince.&rdquo; So the Queen, having
tied a little cooked rice in a packet and given it into the hand of the
Prince, said, &ldquo;Go thou away to any place thou wantest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Prince taking the packet of cooked rice and having
gone on and on, and eaten the packet of cooked rice sitting upon a
rock, looked about, saying, &ldquo;Where is a smoke rising?&rdquo; When
he looked a smoke was visible.</p>
<p>After that, having descended from the rock, as he was going away he
met with some goats; in the party of goats there was a large she-goat.
When the Prince was going near the she-goat, the she-goat
expectorated.</p>
<p>The Prince, taking the piece of spittle and wrapping it in his
handkerchief, went to the house of a widow woman. Having gone there and
given the handkerchief into the hand of the widow-mother, he said,
&ldquo;Mother, having placed this handkerchief in the very bottommost
pot,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10384src" href="#xd27e10384" name=
"xd27e10384src">16</a> put it away.&rdquo; After that, the woman having
placed the handkerchief in the very bottommost pot, put it away.</p>
<p>After seven days went by, having taken out the handkerchief, at the
time when he looked [in the pot] three Princesses and four young rats
were there, and filled the pot. Afterwards he took the three Princesses
out of the pot. Having taken them out, placing the three Princesses in
that very house, the Prince, marrying them, remained there.</p>
<p>While he was living in that very way, news reached the King, the
Prince&rsquo;s father, that this Prince is living with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>(<i>lit.</i>, near) the widow-mother. Afterwards
the King came there on horse-back, together with the army. Having come,
he said to the Prince, &ldquo;Can you pluck and give me the Blue-lotus
flower which is in the Great Sea?&rdquo; Then the Prince said, &ldquo;I
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owing to it, the widow woman was weeping at the Prince&rsquo;s
saying he can. The three Princesses asked, &ldquo;What, mother, are you
weeping for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the widow-mother says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Now then, my son will
die when he has gone into the Great Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the three Princesses say, &ldquo;An&#275;! What do you weep at
that for? Bring a little sand from an untrodden place.&rdquo; The widow
woman brought a little sand from an untrodden place.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the youngest Princess, having uttered spells over the
sand, and given it into the Prince&rsquo;s hand, said, &ldquo;Having
gone into the Sea, when you put down this little sand, firm sand will
become clear (<i>i.e.</i>, will appear above the water). Having gone a
little distance again, when you again put down a little sand, firm sand
will become clear. Having come quite close [to the flower], when you
have held the hands in a cup shape the Blue-lotus flower will come into
the hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Prince, in that very manner having gone upon the
hard sand, held his hands in a cup shape; then it came into his hands.
Having taken it, when he comes back the King is still at the widow
woman&rsquo;s house. Afterwards the Prince gave the Blue-lotus flower
into the King&rsquo;s hand. Thereupon the King thought to himself,
&ldquo;&#256;h&#803;, Bola! by this also I was unable to kill this
one.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10411src" href="#xd27e10411"
name="xd27e10411src">17</a></p>
<p>There is a Bee-hive in a forest; no one can draw out [the honey
combs]. The bees come further than two gawwas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10416src" href="#xd27e10416" name="xd27e10416src">18</a> (each of
four miles) [to attack would-be plunderers of the hive]. To draw out
that Bee-hive the King told this Prince. The Prince said, &ldquo;I
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards that widow-mother is weeping. Then the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>three Princesses asked, &ldquo;What is it,
mother, you are weeping for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the widow-mother said, &ldquo;When my son has gone to draw out
[the honey-combs at] the Bee-hive, the bees having stung (<i>lit.</i>,
eaten) him he will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princesses said, &ldquo;What are you crying for on that
account? Come back [after] breaking a branch without disease or former
disease.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10431src" href="#xd27e10431"
name="xd27e10431src">19</a> Afterwards the woman, breaking a branch
without disease or former disease, came back and gave it.</p>
<p>After that, the youngest Princess, having uttered spells for the
branch, and given it into the Prince&rsquo;s hand, said, &ldquo;Strike
at the Bee-hive with this branch; then the bees will go. Well then, you
will be able to draw the Bee-hive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince, having taken the branch, and gone to the place where the
Bee-hive is, struck the Bee-hive with the branch. The bees went away.
The Prince, drawing out [the honey-comb of] the Bee-hive,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10443src" href="#xd27e10443" name=
"xd27e10443src">20</a> came back and gave it to the King.</p>
<p>The King thought to himself, &ldquo;&#256;h&#803;, Bola! after I was
unable to kill this one by this also, what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking [thus], he cut a well. Having cut it, and at the very
bottom<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10453src" href="#xd27e10453" name=
"xd27e10453src">21</a> having left a little earth, he said to the
Prince, &ldquo;Having descended down this, you must take out this earth
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Prince told it at the hand of the widow-mother; then
the widow-mother wept. The young rats asked, &ldquo;What is it, mother,
that you are weeping for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow-mother said, &ldquo;When our son has gone into that well
he will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the four young rats said, &ldquo;What are you weeping for at
that?&rdquo; From the house to the well they cut a tunnel. Having cut
it, they said at the Prince&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;We have cut the tunnel
from this house until the time <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323"
href="#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>when it goes to the well.
When you have gone into the well, should the King close it with
earth<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10479src" href="#xd27e10479" name=
"xd27e10479src">22</a> come along this tunnel.&rdquo; Having said
[this], they showed the tunnel to the Prince.</p>
<p>On the following day, the King having told the Prince to descend
into the well, the King remained on the surface. The Prince having
descended into the well, when he is about (<i>lit.</i>, making) to try
to take a little earth the King closed it with earth.</p>
<p>Then this Prince having come along that tunnel to the house of the
widow-mother, remained [there].</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there were three Princes, [the
sons] of a nobleman. Having called the eldest Prince of the same three
Princes he asks from the same Prince, &ldquo;Son, what is the work thou
canst do?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Thereupon the big Prince says, &ldquo;Father, having gone to a
threshing-floor on the [full moon] p&#333;ya day, on the fifteenth of
the light half [of the lunar month], it would be good to spread [and
thresh] the stacks, if the moon be shining and shining,&rdquo; he said.
Thereupon he told the same Prince to go aside.</p>
<p>Having called the next Prince he asked, &ldquo;Son, on the second
p&#333;ya day, on the fifteenth of this bright half [of the lunar
month], what is the best work to do? What the best journey to go
on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince says, &ldquo;Father, according to me, on the second
p&#333;ya day, on the fifteenth of the bright half, when they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>have put packs on seven or eight pairs of bulls,
if they drive them [on a trading journey] when the moon is shining and
shining, it would be good,&rdquo; he said. Thereupon the father told
the Prince to go aside.</p>
<p>Having called the young Prince he asked, &ldquo;Son, on this second
p&#333;ya day, on the fifteenth of the bright half [of the lunar
month], what is the best work to do? What are the best journeys to go
on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the young Prince says, &ldquo;Father, according to me, if
I should have placed the head on the Goat Queen&rsquo;s waist pocket,
my shoulder on the Blue-Lotus Queen&rsquo;s waist pocket, my two feet
on the M&#299;-flower Queen&rsquo;s waist pocket, it would be
good,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the father says to the above-mentioned two Princes,
&ldquo;Cut down this wicked Prince with the sword,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>At that time, because they could not kill the young Prince, the
above-mentioned two Princes did not speak. Then their mother, having
called the above-mentioned two Princes, says, &ldquo;Having fulfilled
the hopes of seven kalpas,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10533src" href=
"#xd27e10533" name="xd27e10533src">24</a> [after] being hidden in the
womb of one mother you [three] were born. Because of it, do not cut
down your younger brother at your father&rsquo;s word,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>Having said [to their father], &ldquo;We are going away to cut him
down,&rdquo; they abandoned him in the midst of a very great forest;
and having killed a lizard (<i lang="si-latn">ka&#7789;uss&#257;</i>)
and said they killed the Prince, smearing the blood on the sword they
came back, and said, &ldquo;Father, we killed the Prince,&rdquo; and
gave him the sword. Thereupon he became [filled] with happiness or
great satisfaction.</p>
<p>At the time when the Prince who was left in the midst of the forest
was going along in the forest wilderness for seven days, as he was
going along eating and eating sugar-canes, pine-apples, sweet oranges,
various ripe fruits, he saw a great mountain. Having seen an aerial
root of a Banyan which swung there, seizing the aerial root he went
[climbing up it] to the rock, and when he looked about he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>saw
a rock cave, and not a country furnished with villages (<i lang=
"si-latn">gama ra&#7789;ak</i>).</p>
<p>Thereupon, holding the aerial root of the Banyan he descended to the
ground at the rock, and went away in the direction of the rock cave.
Having seen a house near the rock the Prince went to the house.</p>
<p>A woman, called the Mal-k&#257;ra Amm&#257; (garland-making mother),
who takes messages to the King of that country, saw that the Prince was
going. At the time when she asked, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; a
flock of goats which were there saw him, and a large female goat
coughed. Thereupon a piece of mucus fell down. Taking the piece of
mucus, he tied it up in his waist-pocket.</p>
<p>Thereafter, to the garland-making mother he says, &ldquo;I am going
to a place where they give food and clothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the garland-making mother says, &ldquo;I have no child; come,
for me to rear you,&rdquo; she said. The Prince said, &ldquo;It is
good,&rdquo; [and went to live with her].</p>
<p>Thereupon, having put [for him] outside [her room] cooked rice and
curry, the flower mother went to inform the King. She having thus gone,
the things that were in the waist-pocket of the above-mentioned Prince
who came to the house, came to their time.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10559src" href="#xd27e10559" name="xd27e10559src">25</a></p>
<p>After three days, the Prince having arisen, on seeing the
garland-making mother says, &ldquo;Mother, I will take these flowers
and give them to the King,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the garland-making mother said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
go.&rdquo; Thereafter, the garland-making mother went to the city [to
present the flower-garlands], and came back.</p>
<p>On the following day, when the above-mentioned Prince said that he
must go to another place, the garland-making mother says, &ldquo;Son,
beginning from your young age, I reared you until the time when you are
becoming as big as this. Now, to what place are you to go?&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so, indeed. Give me the thing that I gave you that day
to put away,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the garland-making mother, having gone to take the thing
which she had put in the lowest earthen pot <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>that
was at the bottom of three or four earthen pots, when she looked saw
that a Princess was in it, and being pleased took her out. Then the
garland-making mother says, &ldquo;This Princess is good for my
son,&rdquo; and she gave her in marriage to him.</p>
<p>Not much time afterwards, at the time when he was sleeping in that
manner [which he mentioned to his father], placing his head on the
waist-pocket of the above-mentioned Princess, the Ministers of the King
of that country having seen it, told the tale to the King.</p>
<p>On the following day, on seeing the garland-making mother he said,
&ldquo;Your son is a very great clever person. In the midst of the
Great Sea there will be a great Blue-Lotus flower. Because of [his
cleverness] tell him to bring and give me it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The garland-making mother having come away weeping and weeping, came
home. Thereupon, the Goat Queen asks, &ldquo;What, mother, (<i lang=
"si-latn">maeniyan wahansa</i>), are you crying for?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>The mother says, &ldquo;He said that he is to bring the Blue-Lotus
flower that is in the midst of the Great Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without fear on that account, eat cooked rice,&rdquo; she
said. Having waited a little time, she asked, &ldquo;Can you bring and
give [me] three handfuls of sand from a place they are not trampling
on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said &ldquo;I can,&rdquo; she brought and gave them.</p>
<p>The daughter-in-law, taking the three handfuls of sand, and having
given them into the hand of her husband, says, &ldquo;Having gone,
taking those three handfuls of sand, throw down a handful; white sand
will open out. Having gone upon that white sand, throw down the next
handful; [the sand will then be extended]. Having thrown down the other
handful of sand [the sand-bank will extend to the flower]; then taking
the Queen of the Blue-Lotus flower, and plucking the flower, come
back,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Having gone in the manner stated by his Queen, taking the Queen and
the Blue-Lotus flower he came back. Marrying the Queen, he gave the
Blue-Lotus flower into the mother&rsquo;s hand. The garland-making
mother having gone <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327"
name="pb327">327</a>]</span>to the royal house, and given the
Blue-Lotus flower to the King, came back.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the Ministers having come, for the above-mentioned Prince
there was one Queen before; at the time when they looked now there are
two. &ldquo;Now then, indeed, the King will not succeed in exercising
the sovereignty,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>On the following day, the garland-making mother having waited [at
the palace] until the time for going, [the King] says, &ldquo;Your son
is a great clever person. Because of it, tell him to break [into] the
Royal Bee-hive<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10602src" href="#xd27e10602"
name="xd27e10602src">26</a> (<i lang="si-latn">Raja-m&#299;ya</i>) that
is in the jungle, and come back [with the honey-combs],&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The garland-making mother having come back, when she was weeping and
weeping, the above-mentioned Blue-Lotus-flower Queen asked,
&ldquo;What, mother, are you weeping and weeping for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the garland-making mother says, &ldquo;Having brought [the
honey-combs of] the Royal Bee-hive that is in the jungle, [the Prince]
is to give him them, the King said. Because of it, indeed, I am
weeping,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without fear on that account, come and eat cooked
rice,&rdquo; she said. Then when the garland-making mother is eating
cooked rice, the Blue-Lotus Queen says, &ldquo;Can you bring and give
me three handfuls of stones from a place they are not trampling
on?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Having said &ldquo;I can,&rdquo; she brought and gave them.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blue-Lotus Queen, having given the three handfuls of
stones into the hand of her husband, says, &ldquo;From these three
handfuls of stones taking one handful, go and throw it into the jungle.
The bees will stop while you go three gawuwas (twelve miles). Having
gone there, throw down the other handful; [they will then not attack
you until you go to the bee-hive]. Having gone to the bee-hive they
will assemble [to attack you]. Throw the other handful at the bee-hive,
the head part of the bee-hive; the bees will go to the head part (the
upper part). Then, breaking [into] the bee-hive, come back [with the
honey-combs], calling the Queen who is in the bee-hive,&rdquo; she
said. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thereupon, the Prince went, and breaking [into] the bee-hive and
calling the Queen, came back, and gave [the honey-combs] into the hand
of the garland-making mother. Then the garland-making mother, taking
the honey and having gone to the city, gave it to the King.</p>
<p>At that time the King says, &ldquo;Because your son is a very great
clever person he does the things I am saying and saying. Because of it,
tell your son to come to the city to-morrow,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the garland-making mother having come weeping and weeping
says, &ldquo;To-morrow, indeed, he is really to kill my son. He says he
is to go to the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Queen who was in the Royal Bee-hive says, &ldquo;Without
fear on that account, come and eat cooked rice.&rdquo; Thereafter she
says [to the Prince], &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s message indeed I know.
Having told them to cut a well, and caused you to descend into the
well, it is indeed to kill you he told you to go. For it, I will inform
you of a stratagem,&rdquo; she said. When he asked &ldquo;What is the
stratagem?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Having gone near the well, without
crookedness drawing a line from it, go a considerable distance. From
there having gone cutting a tunnel, do thou cut it to the well, and
come back,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He did in the manner his wife said. Having done the work, and gone
to the city, he saw the King, and remained there.</p>
<p>Then the King says, &ldquo;The well has been [partly] filled up.
Because of it, let us go to draw out the small quantity of
earth.&rdquo; Having said this, that man and yet more people went.</p>
<p>Having gone there, and put [a ladder of] bamboos into the well, he
caused that man to descend. Having waited until the time when he
descended to the foot of the well, he [drew up the ladder, and] began
to throw down earth. Thereupon the man, ascertaining that he is
throwing down earth, breaking down that little that remained at the
tunnel that had been cut [by him], went into the tunnel, and having
come along it, came to his house.</p>
<p>Well then, the King, having filled the well, and said, &ldquo;This
one will be killed,&rdquo; with pleasure came to the city. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span></p>
<p>This above-mentioned man having thought, &ldquo;This King I must
kill,&rdquo; made a stratagem. What was that stratagem, indeed? Cooking
a box of cakes, and having gone to the city and given them to the King,
he says, &ldquo;Your Majesty (<i lang="si-latn">Devayan
wahans&#275;</i>), having remained there at the time when you were
putting me into the well, when you were closing it with earth I went to
that [other] world. Having been there, I brought a box as a present
(<i lang="si-latn">penum pe&#7789;&#7789;iyak</i>) for Your
Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the King says, &ldquo;We also must go to that world.
Because of it, put me down a well,&rdquo; he said. Then having put the
King into the well they closed it with earth.</p>
<p>In not many days, perceiving that the King was lost, and
ascertaining that there was no one for the sovereignty, they decorated
the tusk elephant, and went seeking a person for the sovereignty. The
tusk elephant went and kneeled to the man whom they put in the well.
Thereupon, they having come [to the palace] with that man and with
those three Queens, he exercised the sovereignty.</p>

iii, p. 227, a King of &#346;r&#257;vasti, who wished to get possession
of the beautiful wife of an up&#257;saka, sent him, by the advice of
his Ministers, to bring lotus flowers of five colours from a distant
pool. All who were sent on this errand were killed by venomous snakes
or demons or savage animals, but a demon whom he encountered saved the
up&#257;saka on learning of his piety, and fetched the flowers for him.
When the King heard of this he begged his forgiveness. <span class=

<p class="first">In a certain country there is a nobleman (<i lang=
"si-latn">Si&#7789;&#257;n&#333;</i>), it is said. There is a Princess
of the nobleman&rsquo;s, it is said. The Princess having become
associated with the servant at the house, in secret they went to
another country, it is said.</p>
<p>At the time when the two persons had been there a long time, the
Princess became pregnant.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10683src" href=
"#xd27e10683" name="xd27e10683src">1</a> When the ten months were
coming to be fulfilled she said to the Princess&rsquo;s husband,<a id=
"xd27e10687" name="xd27e10687"></a> &ldquo;Dear (<i lang=
"si-latn">son&#774;dura</i>), let us go to seek our two parents.&rdquo;
At that word her husband was displeased. Afterwards, in not many days
the child was born.</p>
<p>When they had been some time thus, a fresh child was conceived. At
the time when the ten months were coming to be fulfilled for that
child, she said, &ldquo;Dear, it is very difficult for me. Because of
it, let us go to seek our two parents,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>After that procuring all [necessary] provisions, afterwards they
began to go. Having gone thus, that day it became night. They stayed
near a tree in the midst of the forest. Because rain was coming, having
said he must construct a leaf [parturition] house (<i lang=
"si-latn">kolasun geyak</i>) he went to cut sticks, creepers, etc.
Having gone, at the time when he was cutting them sitting upon an
ant-hill, the N&#257;ga King who stayed in the ant-hill bit (<i lang=
"si-latn">da&#7789;&#7789;a kal&#257;</i>) her husband in the leg; the
man died there.</p>
<p>At the time when that woman, placing the child near her,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>was staying [there], pain in the body having
seized the woman she bore [a child]. Then rain began to rain. That
night, until it became light, how much was her trouble for sleep! After
it became light in the morning she went to seek her husband. Having
gone, at the time when she was going walking she saw that the man is
dead.</p>
<p>From there, weeping and weeping, having walked [back] to the place
where the children were, and having descended to the road carrying the
two children, while she was going away to the very city of her two
parents there was water in the river [that she must cross] on the
road.</p>
<p>After that, having gone to that [far] bank carrying the elder child,
and having made the child stay there, she came to the middle of the
river [in order] to return to this bank. Then, having seen that an
eagle striking the child she bore yester-night was taking it, she
clapped her hands and shouted. Then the child who was on that [far]
bank said, <span class="corr" id="xd27e10710" title=
"Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>Mother is calling,&rdquo; and sprang
into the river. Then, of both children, one the eagle took away, one
having fallen in the water died. The two children were lost, and the
man was lost.</p>
<p>Well then, having said, &ldquo;I myself must still go to seek my two
parents,&rdquo; at the time when she was going she met with a man of
that city whom she knew. From the man this woman asked, &ldquo;Is the
affliction of my two parents light, or what?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;Thy two parents&rsquo; mansion (<i lang=
"si-latn">pras&#257;da</i>) having broken down and fallen last night on
account of the rain, and the two having died, it is the smoke, indeed,
of the funeral pyre which burns the two, that is visible there,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>After that, the woman lost her senses, and being without goods she
began to go on still, quite like a mad person. The
D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; taking as his dwelling-place the Banyan-tree
near the road, thought, &ldquo;Should this woman go on this path,
through that depression of spirits she will jump into the fire that
burns those two persons. I must show this woman a different
path.&rdquo; Having said [this], he showed [her it]. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span></p>
<p>The woman went on that path. Having gone, she went to a pansala.
Having gone to it and become a nun she remained there until she died.

<p class="first">This is part of the story of the misfortunes of
K&#7771;i&#347;a Gautam&#299;, one of the chief Buddhist nuns, as they
are related in the Tibetan <i>Kah-gyur</i> (A. von Schiefner&rsquo;s
<i>Tibetan Tales</i>, Ralston, p. 216). Her father was a rich
householder of Benares, by whom she was married to a young merchant.
For her first confinement she returned home, afterwards rejoining her
husband. For the second, she and her husband went off in a waggon in
which she was confined when they had gone about half way. Her husband
sat down under a tree to await the event, fell asleep, a snake bit him,
and he died on the spot. When the woman got down she found he was dead.
In the meantime a thief stole the oxen. She then walked on with the
children till she came to a river, flooded by a sudden rain. She
carried the infant across, and while returning in the water for the
other saw a jackal carry off the baby. When she waved her hands to
frighten the animal, the elder child, thinking she was calling him,
sprang down a high bank into the river, and was killed. The mother
pursued the jackal, which dropped the infant, but it was then dead. At
about the same time her parents and all their household but one man
were destroyed by a hurricane. She met the survivor and heard his sad
story, after which she wandered to a hill village, and lived with an
old woman, spinning cotton yarn. After other unfortunate experiences
she became a Buddhist nun. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href=

<p class="first">My friend Mr. C. Tucker, of Harrogate, has been good
enough to show me a variant of this story in a work called <i>Lessons
of Thrift</i>, by a member of the Save-all Club, published in 1820. It
is related of King Louis XI. of France.</p>
<p>A peasant who had ingratiated himself by his services, when the King
succeeded to the throne brought him a turnip of extraordinary size as
the only present within his power. The King gave him one thousand
livres in return. His landlord, a country squire, hearing of it,
thought he must profit by this weakness of the King&rsquo;s, and said
to himself, &ldquo;If this madman give a thousand livres for a turnip,
what will he give me for that beautiful horse in my best stable!&rdquo;
He took the horse to the Court. The King was delighted, and said,
&ldquo;Your noble disinterested present shall be richly
rewarded.&rdquo; Then the King produced the turnip, with this sarcasm,
&ldquo;This, you know, cost me a thousand livres, and I give it you in
return for your horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Keightley&rsquo;s <i>Tales and Popular Fictions</i>, pp. 253 ff.,
there are two Italian variants in which a cat was bestowed by a King as
a gift in return for presents of great value. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Prince and the Minister</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain city there were a King and a Queen; the
Queen had a Prince and a Princess. While they were thus, the King and
Queen reached a very great age. Afterwards the King says to the
Minister, &ldquo;When the Prince has become big give him the
kingship;&rdquo; having said it, he gave the [temporary] kingship to
the Minister. After that, the King and Queen died.</p>
<p>After that, while the Minister and Prince and Princess, these three
persons, are living thus, the Minister becomes changed towards the
Prince. The men of that country perceived it. After that, men say to
the Prince, &ldquo;Should you, Sir, stay, the Minister will behead you;
you go to another country,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>After that, the Prince, taking the painting (portrait) of the
Princess, said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you descend from the floor of the
upper story until the time when I come back.&rdquo; Saying it, the
Prince went to another city. The Prince went near a widow woman of that
city.</p>
<p>The widow woman asks, &ldquo;Of what village are you?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>The Prince says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either my village or
country,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, the widow woman says, &ldquo;You stay near me.&rdquo;
When she said it, the Prince having said, &ldquo;It is good,
mother,&rdquo; remained no long time.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the King of the city, having been at the palace, is
going near the widow woman&rsquo;s house, the King having seen that the
Prince is in the open space in front of the house, the King came back
to the palace laughing with pleasure, and called the Minister. After
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>Minister came running, the King says,
&ldquo;To-day a pleasure has gone to me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Minister says, &ldquo;Who is the man whom you, Sir, saw to-day
in the morning? If you, Sir, see that man every day in the morning it
will be good,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, the King says to the Minister, &ldquo;Calling the widow
woman and the boy, come back,&rdquo; he said. Afterwards the Minister,
summoning them, came.</p>
<p>The King says to the widow woman, &ldquo;Give me the boy; I will
give him food, drink, and clothing,&rdquo; he said. The widow woman
gave him the boy.</p>
<p>After that, the King having built a house for the boy, and given him
food, drink, and clothing, said, &ldquo;Show yourself to me in the
morning at six,&rdquo; he said. The Prince on the following day went at
six, and stayed [there]. After that, the Prince on the following day
came at seven.</p>
<p>Then the King says, &ldquo;Why are you such a time?&rdquo; he asked.
The Prince says, &ldquo;I went to sleep,&rdquo; he said. After that,
the Prince on the following day at eight went near the King.</p>
<p>Afterwards the King says to the Prince, &ldquo;Should you not come
at six to-morrow I shall behead you,&rdquo; and scolded him. On the day
after that the Prince did not go at all.</p>
<p>After that, the King, having called the servants, says, &ldquo;Look
ye for what [reason] that Prince did not come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servants having gone, when they are peeping through the door,
the Prince lying down and taking a painting, kisses it, weeps, places
it on the ground, takes it again. These servants having seen it, told
the King. &ldquo;If so, seizing the Prince come [with him],&rdquo; he
said. The Minister, seizing him, came.</p>
<p>The King asks, &ldquo;Why did you not come?&rdquo; Then the Prince
said, &ldquo;I went to sleep.&rdquo; Then the King said, &ldquo;Give me
your painting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Prince brought and gave it. As soon as the King
looked at the painting he asked, &ldquo;What [relative] of
yours<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10813src" href="#xd27e10813" name=
"xd27e10813src">1</a> is this Princess?&rdquo; The Prince said,
&ldquo;My younger sister.&rdquo; Then the King says, &ldquo;Bring the
Princess for me to marry her.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Minister says, &ldquo;Having been keeping that woman three
months, because she is a courtesan I sent her away,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;This Minister neither saw my younger sister,
and nor was keeping her. If you were keeping her, mention the
Princess&rsquo;s marks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minister says to the King, &ldquo;Please put this Prince in
prison until the time when I come,&rdquo; he said to the King. He put
the Prince in prison.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Minister, asking the King for the Princess&rsquo;s
portrait, and taking a good entertainment, having embarked, went to the
city in which is the Princess. Having gone [there] he exhibits the
entertainment.</p>
<p>The old woman who is with (<i>lit.</i>, near) the Princess having
seen it, [said] to the Princess, &ldquo;There is an entertainment which
was never at our city. Let us go to look at it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>After that, the Princess says, &ldquo;Elder brother said,
&lsquo;Until the time when I come don&rsquo;t descend from the floor of
the upper story.&rsquo; Because of it I will not. You look and come
back,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Afterwards, having seen the old woman the Minister asks, &ldquo;Is
there a Princess [here] like this picture?&rdquo; Then the old woman
said, &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; she said. The Minister said to the old
woman, &ldquo;[After] calling her come back,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, the old woman says, &ldquo;The Princess&rsquo;s elder
brother said, &lsquo;Until the time when I come back don&rsquo;t
descend from the floor of the upper story,&rsquo; he said; because of
it she will not descend,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Then the Minister says, &ldquo;Tell me a mark of the
Princess&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the old woman said, &ldquo;There is not another mark of the
Princess&rsquo;s to tell you; on the right thigh there is the
birth-mark (<i lang="si-latn">upan-lakuna</i>),&rdquo; she said to the
Minister.</p>
<p>After the Minister went back to the palace he said to the King,
&ldquo;Please tell that Prince to come,&rdquo; he said. The King caused
the Prince to be brought. Afterwards the Minister said to the Prince,
&ldquo;On the right thigh of your younger sister there is the
birth-mark only; no other mark,&rdquo; he said. The Prince said,
&ldquo;Yes, [it is so].&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337"
href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span></p>
<p>After that, the King commanded them to hang this Prince. The Prince
says to the King, &ldquo;I must [first] look at younger sister, and
come.&rdquo; After that, the King sent the Prince with two men. The
Prince having gone to the floor of the upper story, and beaten the
Princess [and told her what the Minister said], the Prince came again
to the city in which is the King. The Princess having been weeping and
weeping went to sleep.</p>
<p>Afterwards the King, [in order] to hang the Prince, took him upon
the scaffold. That Princess learnt that he is hanging the Prince. After
that, the Princess having mounted on a horse, the King saw her come
driving it along. The King [said], &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hang the Prince
just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Princess having come, and descended from the back of
the horse, and tied the horse at a tree, the Princess sat on a chair
near the King. The Princess asks at the hand of the King, &ldquo;Why
are these people [here] in this manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King says, &ldquo;To-day I am hanging a Prince; because of it
the people have come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Princess says to the King, &ldquo;The Minister
having been keeping me three months, taking my slipper came away. Be
good enough to ask for it, and give me it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;Minister, if you brought it give her
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minister says, &ldquo;That Princess I neither kept nor
know,&rdquo; the Minister said.</p>
<p>Afterwards, having caused the Prince to descend from the scaffold,
the King [said], &ldquo;Who is this of yours?&rdquo; The Prince said,
&ldquo;My younger sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the King having caused the Minister to be brought, [told
him who she was, and asked], &ldquo;Why did you tell lies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that the Minister says, &ldquo;You, Sir, will marry the
Princess; you will give the Minister&rsquo;s work to the Prince.
Because of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King ordered them to hang the Minister.</p>
<p>The King married that Princess. [The Prince] having <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>gone
to the Prince&rsquo;s [own] palace, took the kingship from the Minister
[who had been ruling temporarily]. To the Minister he gave the
Minister&rsquo;s work [again].</p>

<p class="first">With regard to the order to hang the Prince, and the
subsequent hanging of the Minister, there is a reference to this
punishment in the next story, in which a Minister recommends that a
turtle which had frightened some Princesses should be hanged. In vol.
i, p. 368, a jackal remarked that a leopard which had been caught in a
noose had been &ldquo;hanged,&rdquo; as though this were a well-known
punishment. I think there is no other clear instance in these stories;
but in vol. i, p. 189, a Prince found a Yaksan&#299; trying to eat a
dead body which was hanging in a tree; if this had been a case of
suicide the relatives might have removed the body. Hanging the body at
the four gates of the city after quartering it is mentioned in two of
these tales (vol. i, pp. 86 and 89, and in No. 80, p. 20 of the present
volume). Hanging is not referred to in the stories of the Low-Country
Sinhalese, where one might expect to meet with it.</p>
<p>In the W&#275;vaelkae&#7789;iya Inscription (<i lang="la">Epigraphia
Zeylanica</i>, vol. i, p. 250), King Mahinda IV. (<span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 1026&ndash;1042) ordered that persons convicted of
robbery with violence should be hanged. Mr. Wickremasinghe in giving a
translation of this inscription added a note to the effect that he had
not found this punishment mentioned elsewhere in Sinhalese literature;
but in the <i lang="sa-latn">Mah&#257;vansa</i>, ii, lxxv, vv. 166 and
196, and in the <i lang="sa-latn">R&#257;j&#257;valiya</i>
(translation), p. 66, there are accounts of the hanging of people. In
Marshall&rsquo;s <i>Ceylon</i>, p. 39, it is stated that &ldquo;the
punishment of death was usually carried into effect by hanging, or
being killed by elephants.&rdquo; In Davy&rsquo;s work also, p. 182, it
is said that &ldquo;the sentence of death, in cases of murder, was
carried into effect by hanging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. ii, p. 185, a young man who was in love with a Princess received
her portrait from a painter, and &ldquo;spent his time in gazing on,
coaxing and touching, and adorning her picture; &hellip; he seemed to
see her, though she was only a painted figure, talking to him and
kissing him, &hellip; and he was contented, because the whole world was
for him contained in that piece of painted canvas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the <i>Arabian Nights</i> (Lady Burton&rsquo;s ed., vol. i, p.
183), when a Waz&#299;r showed his young son to a Sultan, the latter
was so much pleased with him that he said, &ldquo;O Waz&#299;r, thou
must needs bring him daily to my presence.&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Story of King Bamba</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there is a King. There are seven
Princesses (daughters) of the King. He does not allow the seven
Princesses to go anywhere outside [the palace precincts], and having
caused a pool to be dug in the very palace for bathing, also, the
Princesses bathe [in it].</p>
<p>When they have bathed, there is a drain for letting out the water. A
Turtle came along the drain, and having entered the pool, when it was
there, one day the water having filled the pool the Princesses went.
While they were having water-games, one Princess struck against the
Turtle, and while she was crying out [in alarm], the other six having
become afraid sprang ashore. Having sprung there and gone running, they
told their father the King.</p>
<p>Afterwards the King and Ministers having come and opened the drain,
when they looked after the water lowered there was a Turtle. The
Ministers took away the Turtle. Thereupon the King said, &ldquo;For the
fault that it frightened my Princesses, what is the suitable punishment
to inflict on this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a Minister said, &ldquo;Having fixed a noose to its neck and
hung it up for thirty paeyas (twelve hours), let it go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon another Minister said, &ldquo;The punishment is not good
enough. Not in that way. Having prepared a bon-fire you ought to put
this Turtle into the bon-fire.&rdquo; Thereupon the Turtle laughed.</p>
<p>Then yet [another] Minister said, &ldquo;That punishment is not good
enough; I will tell you one. In the Atirawat&#299;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e10933src" href="#xd27e10933" name="xd27e10933src">1</a> river
the water is very swift; the water goes and falls into <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>the
N&#257;ga residence.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10938src" href=
"#xd27e10938" name="xd27e10938src">2</a> Having taken that one you
ought to put it into that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Turtle, after having shrugged its shoulders, said, &ldquo;O
Lord, Your Majesty, though you should inflict all other punishments
don&rsquo;t inflict that punishment on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as it was saying it, the King said, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Take
that to that very one and put it in.&rdquo; After that, the Ministers
having taken the Turtle put it into the Atirawat&#299; river.</p>
<p>When it was put in, the Turtle, having gone turning and turning
round, fell into the N&#257;ga residence. Well then, the shore is not a
suitable place. Now then, the Turtle thinks, &ldquo;Should I stay thus
the N&#257;gay&#257;s, seizing me, will eat me. Because of it, I must
go near the great N&#257;ga King, <span class="corr" id="xd27e10955"
title="Source: Mahak&#277;la">Mahakela</span><a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10957src" href="#xd27e10957" name="xd27e10957src">3</a> by
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great N&#257;ga King, Mahakela by name, having seen this Turtle,
asked, &ldquo;Whence camest thou? Who art thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Turtle gave answer, &ldquo;O Lord, Your Majesty, they call
me, indeed, the Minister, P&#363;rnaka by name, of King Bamba of Bamba
City. Because there was no other man to come [to make] appearance
(<i lang="si-latn">daekuma</i>) before Your Honour (<i lang=
"si-latn">num&#774;ba-wahans&#275;</i>), His Majesty our King sent
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the N&#257;ga King asked, &ldquo;What is the business for which
he sent thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Turtle says, &ldquo;There are seven Princesses of His
Majesty our King. Out of them, His Majesty our King is willing to give
any Princess you want, for the N&#257;ga residence. Because of it he
sent me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the N&#257;ga King says, &ldquo;It is good. If he is thus
willing I will cause two persons to make the journey with
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Turtle says, &ldquo;O Lord, Your Majesty, permission has
been given to me for [only] seven days&rsquo; [absence]; because of it,
I must go this very day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the great N&#257;ga King, Mahakela by name, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>having despatched two N&#257;gay&#257;s, said,
&ldquo;Ye having gone to the world of men (<i lang=
"si-latn">nara-lowa</i>), looking into matters there, until ye come
back do no injury to anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, when these two N&#257;gay&#257;s and the Turtle are
coming along the Turtle says, &ldquo;I am unable to go like Your
Honours go; having lifted me up carry me a little.&rdquo; After that,
the two N&#257;gay&#257;s, lifting up the Turtle, came [with him] to
this world.</p>
<p>Having come near the city, the Turtle said, &ldquo;Now then, place
me on the ground; I cannot go thus. When I have gone to the palace, the
Princesses having come and said, &lsquo;Our Minister has come,&rsquo;
will ask at my hand certain articles. Because of it, I will go to that
pool; until the time when I come [after] plucking a handful of flowers,
you stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said [this], the Turtle went to the pool; after it descended
[into it] those two N&#257;gay&#257;s are looking [out for it]. The
Turtle having gone to the pool, got hid.</p>
<p>The two N&#257;gay&#257;s having gone to Bamba City, after they went
near the King, the King asked, &ldquo;From what country came
ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the N&#257;gay&#257;s said, &ldquo;What is [the meaning of]
that speech that Your Honour is saying? Your Honour must understand. By
Your Honour a Minister [was] sent to our N&#257;ga
dwelling-place&mdash;was he not?&mdash;thereafter to tell us to come.
That there are Your Honour&rsquo;s seven Princesses, Your
Honour&rsquo;s Minister, P&#363;rnaka by name, went and told our King.
Afterwards our King sent us two, with Your Honour&rsquo;s Minister,
P&#363;rnaka by name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then King Bamba says, &ldquo;Is it true that a King like me gives
[in] marriage to frog-eating beasts like you?&rdquo; Having said it, he
scolded them with many low words.</p>
<p>Afterwards the two N&#257;gay&#257;s having gone again to the
N&#257;ga residence told the N&#257;ga King, &ldquo;King Bamba scolded
us much;&rdquo; having said it the two wept.</p>
<p>Afterwards collecting as many N&#257;gay&#257;s as were [there], the
N&#257;ga King having come to Bamba City, the N&#257;ga King called
Mahakela and yet [another] N&#257;ga King twined [themselves] from the
King&rsquo;s head down to the two feet, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>raising their heads above [him] asked at the
hand of King Bamba, &ldquo;Wilt thou give thy Princess or
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>King Bamba said, &ldquo;To thy taking any Princess thou wantest to
thy country, there is not any impediment by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the N&#257;ga King<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11012src"
href="#xd27e11012" name="xd27e11012src">4</a> having taken a good
[looking] Princess, [a daughter of the King], and gone to the N&#257;ga
residence, married the Princess to a N&#257;gay&#257;.</p>
<p>During the time when she was [there] a child [was] conceived in her
womb. After it was conceived, ten months having become complete she
bore a N&#257;gay&#257;. That N&#257;gay&#257; in not much time having
become big, asked at the hand of his mother, &ldquo;Mother, what is
[the reason] why you alone are unable to take the appearance you
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princess said, &ldquo;Son, how can I take the appearance I
want? I am a human being (<i lang="si-latn">manussayek</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The N&#257;gay&#257; asks, &ldquo;How, mother, was the manner in
which you came to this country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his mother says, &ldquo;In this manner: As many
N&#257;gay&#257;s as were in this N&#257;ga residence having gone and
fought with our father the King, taking me came away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the N&#257;ga Prince says, &ldquo;Mother, I cannot stay
in this country; I must go to the world of men. For it, give me
permission.&rdquo; Afterwards his mother gave the N&#257;ga Prince
permission.</p>
<p>Well then (<i lang="si-latn">etin</i>), the N&#257;gay&#257; having
come to the world of men began to practise asceticism in a rock cave.
When no long time had gone in that manner, a Vaedd&#257; having seen
that the N&#257;gay&#257; is in that rock cave, said to a snake charmer
(<i lang="si-latn">ahi-kantayek</i>), &ldquo;I have seen a
N&#257;gay&#257; thus. Canst thou catch him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The snake charmer (<i lang="si-latn">ahi-kantakay&#257;</i>) having
said &ldquo;I can,&rdquo; and having gone with the Vaedd&#257;, as soon
as he saw the N&#257;gay&#257; the snake charmer [by magic spells] put
on it inability to move.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11043src" href=
"#xd27e11043" name="xd27e11043src">5</a> Having put it on, and caught
the N&#257;gay&#257;, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href=

successively<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11056src" href="#xd27e11056"
name="xd27e11056src">6</a> having made the Cobra dance, the snake
charmer obtained many presents; the snake charmer became very
wealthy.</p>
<p>After that, the N&#257;gay&#257;&rsquo;s mother bore a
N&#257;gay&#257; again. After that N&#257;gay&#257; also became big,
just like the first N&#257;gay&#257; asked, he asked at the hand of his
mother [regarding her appearance]. Then his mother, too, told him just
like she told that first N&#257;gay&#257;.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the N&#257;gay&#257; also asking permission at the hand
of his mother to come to the world of men, on the very day when he came
to the world of men, at the time when the snake charmer was making that
first Cobra dance at the palace of King Bamba, creating a thousand
hoods, the N&#257;gay&#257; who was born afterwards saw him. The
dancing N&#257;gay&#257; also saw that that N&#257;gay&#257; is coming.
At his very coming he sent a poisonous smoke to the snake charmer. The
poisonous smoke having struck him, the snake charmer died at that very
place.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the two N&#257;gay&#257;s were conversing, the
elder N&#257;gay&#257; said, &ldquo;Our grandfather&rsquo;s palace,
indeed, is this. Because of it, indeed, to-day I danced, creating a
thousand hoods. From to-day I shall not dance again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, the two, creating divine bodies, having gone to the midst
of the forest, practised asceticism.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In <i>The J&#257;taka</i>, No. 543 (vol. vi, p. 83)
there is an account of a tortoise (turtle) that frightened the
semi-N&#257;ga sons of Brahmadatta, King of Benares, by raising its
head out of the water of the royal pool when they were playing there.
When it was netted the attendants suggested pounding it to powder in a
mortar, or cooking and eating it, or baking it; and at last a Minister
recommended that it should be thrown into the whirlpool of the
Yamun&#257; river. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344"
name="pb344">344</a>]</span>The turtle begged to be spared this last
fate,&mdash;the one it desired,&mdash;but the King ordered it to be
thrown into the river, in which a current led it to the dwelling of the
N&#257;gas. When the sons of the N&#257;ga King Dhatara&#7789;&#7789;ha
found it, the turtle invented the story of its being a messenger called
Cittac&#363;l&#803;a, sent by the King of Benares to offer his daughter
to the N&#257;ga King. Four N&#257;ga youths returned with the turtle
to fix the wedding day, the turtle concealing itself in a pool on the
way, on the plea of collecting lotus flowers. When the N&#257;gas were
treated with scorn, the N&#257;ga King and his forces compelled the
King to surrender his daughter Samuddaj&#257;, who was married to the
N&#257;ga King.</p>
<p>Her second semi-N&#257;ga son out of four with only his N&#257;ga
wife&rsquo;s knowledge went to fast on the earth, with a view to being
re-born among the Gods. Lying as a cobra on an ant-hill he was pointed
out by an outcast Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, captured by means of a magical
spell, taken to dance in villages, and at last brought to the King of
Benares. The N&#257;ga&rsquo;s eldest brother disguised as an ascetic,
with his N&#257;ga sister, disguised as a young frog that was hidden in
his hair, rescued him. The heat from three drops of poison emitted by
the frog turned the snake charmer into a leper; their virulence, had it
not been magically quenched, would have caused a seven years&rsquo;
drought.</p>
<p>Snake doctors in Ceylon classify the frog as a very poisonous form
of serpent. In <i>Sagas from the Far East</i>, p. 213, a gold frog was
the daughter of the Serpent King, who may have been a N&#257;ga.</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol.
i, p. 188, the story resembles that given in the J&#257;taka tale. The
King&rsquo;s name was An&#775;gada; he had a son and a daughter
A&ntilde;jan&#257;. When the turtle was caught the Ministers advised
beheading it, burning it alive, or chopping it up and making it into
soup; another said these deaths were not cruel enough, and recommended
casting it into the sea; it was thrown into a river. The
N&#257;ga&rsquo;s parents, sister, and brother sought for it in the
form of birds, and the snake charmer was sent away by An&#775;gada,
with presents.</p>
<p>In the same work, vol. iii, p. 346, a Queen bore a human son after
being visited by a great serpent while half asleep. Professor Chavannes
referred to other early instances of such supposed births.</p>
<p>In the Kolh&#257;n folk-tales (Bompas) appended to <i>Folklore of
the Santal Parganas</i>, p. 452, there is an account of a woman who was
married to a water-snake and lived with him under the water, where she
bore four snake sons.</p>
<p>In <i>Kaffir Folk-Lore</i> (Theal), p. 155, a girl became the wife
of Long Snake; after she ran away her sister married him. When he
visited their father the house was set on fire and he was killed. On p.
55 a girl married a five-headed snake who became a man. (See p.

<h2 class="main">Concerning a Royal Princess and a Turtle</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain period, at the time when a King and a
Minister are passing the time with great trust [in each other], the
King and the Minister had a talk in this manner. The talk, indeed, was
thus: To the Minister the King says, &ldquo;Minister, let us two at one
time contract marriage; having contracted it, and your Queen (<i lang=
"si-latn">D&#275;v&#299;</i>) having borne a daughter, should my Queen
bear a son let us accomplish the wedding festival of the two children
who are born first.&rdquo; [This] was his speech.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Minister said thus, &ldquo;It is good, O King; your
Queen having borne a Princess, should my Queen bear a Prince, [or] my
Queen having borne a Princess should your Queen bear a Prince, let us
accomplish the wedding festival,&rdquo; he said. At that the King
having been much pleased, the two persons contracted marriage and
remained passing the time in friendship.</p>
<p>During the time when they are [thus], the royal Queen bore a
Princess endowed with much beauty. On that very day<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e11123src" href="#xd27e11123" name="xd27e11123src">1</a> the
Minister&rsquo;s Queen also bore a Turtle. Concerning the circumstance
that the Minister&rsquo;s Queen bore the Turtle, the King and the
Minister also remained in much grief. During the time when they were
thus, the royal Queen bore yet six Princesses. At the time when she had
borne [the last of them] ten years were fulfilled for the Princess whom
she bore first.</p>
<p>Thereupon this Minister asked the King thus, &ldquo;O Lord,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>Your Majesty, for your Princess and my Turtle,
for both of them, the age has now become equal. Because of it, now
then, let us accomplish the wedding festival;&rdquo; [thus] he
spoke.</p>
<p>At that time, getting into his mind the notion (<i>lit.</i>, word)
that, breaking the word the King has said at first, should he
subsequently say a word otherwise he will go into hostility, the King
unwillingly said thus: &ldquo;You go and ask my Princess about
it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Minister having gone near the Princess asked her.</p>
<p>The Princess said thus, &ldquo;An&#275;! App&#257;! I cannot
accomplish the festival of the marriage to that Turtle,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Minister, not even speaking anything about it, came
out of the palace. Having come, while still a long time is going he
remained without coming back.</p>
<p>Having so remained, after no long time went by they were ready to
accomplish the wedding festival for the other six Princesses of the
King&rsquo;s, also. At that time the Minister having gone still
[another] time, asked the King; the King told him in the very manner he
said before that. Thereupon the Minister having gone asked the
Princess.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Princess said thus: &ldquo;If I am to marry the
Turtle, tell the Turtle to bring a S&#363;riya-k&#257;nt&#257; flower;
should he bring it I will marry him,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The Minister having returned [home], it having come [to him] he told
it to the Turtle. &ldquo;Father, I can bring and give it,&rdquo; the
Turtle said.</p>
<p>Then the Minister would say a word thus [doubtingly] to the Turtle,
&ldquo;Turtle, when would you bring it indeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Turtle, feeling (<i>lit.</i>, bringing) shame at it in
its mind, having descended into a river, went away; and having gone to
the place where the Sun [God, S&#363;riy&#257;], having risen, his
chariot comes, and presented its head to [be crushed by] the chariot
wheel, remained [there].</p>
<p>At that time the Sun asks thus, &ldquo;O Turtle, why didst thou
place thy head at this chariot wheel?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The Turtle says thus, &ldquo;An&#275;! O Sun [God], you, Sir, must
give me a fifth part from your rays (that is, one-fifth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>of
their brilliancy). If not, unless I die here I will not go,&rdquo; it
said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Sun having given power to the Turtle for the manner of
its coming out into the light from its turtle shell, told it to come
outside. Then by the authority of the Sun, the Turtle, abandoning the
turtle shell, came into the light. After it came out it was created a
man. Thereupon he gave him a fifth part from the Sun&rsquo;s rays.
After he gave it, &ldquo;What do you want still?&rdquo; he asked. He
said he wanted a S&#363;riya-k&#257;nt&#257; flower also.</p>
<p>Then the Sun, having shown the path to the house of the
D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; who sleeps three months [at a time], and having
said, &ldquo;Thou having gone, when he arises while thou art displaying
games then ask thou [regarding it],&rdquo; the Sun rose on this
side.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince who was fettered by the disguise of the turtle,
having gone near the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; who sleeps three months,
when he was displaying games the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; awoke, and
asked, &ldquo;Because of what came you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;We came regarding the want of a
S&#363;riya-k&#257;nt&#257; flower for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; showed him the path
[leading] near the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; who sleeps two months.
Having gone there also, he awoke him. Having awakened, he asked the
Prince thus, &ldquo;Regarding what matter did you awake me?&rdquo; he
asked. There, also, the Prince said he came about the want of a
S&#363;riya-k&#257;nt&#257; flower.</p>
<p>Thereupon the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; showed him the path to the
house of the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; who sleeps one month.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11176src" href="#xd27e11176" name=
"xd27e11176src">2</a> Having gone there also, when he was displaying
games that D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; also awoke. At that time he too
asked regarding what want [he had come]. Thereupon he told him in the
very manner he formerly said.</p>
<p>After that, the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; said thus, &ldquo;Look
there. When you have gone along that path there will be a pool in which
the Virgin Women (<i lang=
"si-latn">Kanniy&#257;-Striy&#333;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11183src" href="#xd27e11183" name="xd27e11183src">3</a>) bathe.
Having gone there and been hidden, as soon as the Virgin Women have
descended into the pool to bathe take even those persons&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>wearing apparel. There will be a <i lang=
"si-latn">d&#275;w&#257;laya</i> (temple) just there; having gone into
the d&#275;w&#257;l&#275; shut the door yourself. Then the Virgin Women
having come and told you to open the door, will make games, a
disturbance, and the like. Do you, without opening the door through
their saying those things, say thus: &lsquo;Except that should you
bring and give me a S&#363;ri-k&#257;nt&#257; flower I will open the
door and give you these ornaments, I will not otherwise give
them.&rsquo; Say [this].&rdquo; While saying it he showed the Prince
the path.</p>
<p>The Prince having gone in that very manner, and got hid, while he
was there, in the very way the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; said, the Virgin
Women came and descended into the pool to bathe.</p>
<p>Thereupon this Prince, taking the wearing apparel of the Virgin
Women, went into the d&#275;w&#257;laya which was near there, and shut
the door himself. At that time the Virgin Women having come played
games [outside]. This Prince, not having looked in their direction
even, in the very manner the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; told him before
asked for a S&#363;riya-k&#257;nt&#257; flower.</p>
<p>The Virgin Women said, &ldquo;We will give a
S&#363;ri-k&#257;nt&#257; flower; [be pleased] to give us our
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince while giving only [some] clothes for them to
put on until the time when they give the S&#363;riya-k&#257;nt&#257;
flower, kept back the other wearing apparel. After that, the Virgin
Women, having given oaths, begged for and got the other wearing
apparel, too. [After] begging for them, they brought and gave him a
S&#363;riya-k&#257;nt&#257; flower.</p>
<p>After they gave it, the Prince came near the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257;
who told him the path. As soon as he came the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257;
asked, &ldquo;What else do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must give me a power to beat men, even millions in
number,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; having given him a cudgel,
said, &ldquo;However many [there may be], even to [the extent of] an
army, place this cudgel in the road, and tell it [after] beating them
to come back. [After] beating however many persons [there may be] it
will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking that also, the Prince went near the other
D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href=
"#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>When he went, that
D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; also asked, &ldquo;What else do you
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince said, &ldquo;You must still give me a [magic]
lute (<i lang="si-latn">v&#275;n&#257;wa</i>), and a power to display
the hidden things thought of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, having given him a bag called Kokka,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e11220src" href="#xd27e11220" name="xd27e11220src">4</a> he
said thus, &ldquo;Having placed this bag called Kokka [hanging from
your shoulder], think that anything you want is to make its appearance;
anything you want will appear.&rdquo; Having said this he gave him it.
He gave him a lute: &ldquo;Being at any place you like, play
(<i>lit.</i>, rub) it; any person He<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11226src" href="#xd27e11226" name="xd27e11226src">5</a> wants
will hear and come,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Taking these and having come here from there, because the Virgin
Women are possessors of the power of flight through the air, in order
for them to come from the sky he remembered the party, and played the
lute.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the party came with the speed with which he played it.
After they came, he gave that cudgel and the bag called Kokka, both of
them, into the hand of the Virgin Women, saying, &ldquo;When I want
these, as soon as I play the lute you must very speedily bring and give
me them;&rdquo; and taking also the lute he crept into the turtle shell
again, and came to his own city. What of his coming! Because he is
inside the turtle shell he is still the Turtle.</p>
<p>Well then, having given food and drink to the Turtle, &ldquo;Did you
bring a S&#363;riya-k&#257;nt&#257; flower?&rdquo; his father the
Minister joked.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Turtle said, &ldquo;I have brought a
S&#363;riya-k&#257;nt&#257; flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, &ldquo;If so, bring it,&rdquo; the Turtle&rsquo;s father
said.</p>
<p>After that, having gone outside the city gate, when he was playing
the lute the Virgin Women brought and gave him the
S&#363;ri-k&#257;nt&#257; flower. After they gave it, having brought it
he gave it into his father&rsquo;s hand. Having so given it, when he
presented it to the Princess they accomplished the wedding festival of
[the marriages of] six other Princes to the six younger Princesses who
still remained to the King, and of the Turtle to the eldest Princess.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having accomplished it, during the time when they are thus those six
Princes went hunting. Because they married and gave the eldest daughter
to the Turtle, having built a house outside the palace and given it to
these two, they separated [them from the others].</p>
<p>When this party are going near that house they ask at the hand of
that eldest daughter, &ldquo;Where [is he], Bola? Isn&rsquo;t thy
Turtle going hunting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Princess remains grieved at it. The Turtle, who had
heard it, having called the Princess (<i lang="si-latn">d&#275;vi</i>),
said, &ldquo;Go to the royal palace, and asking for a horse and a sword
for me bring them.&rdquo; At that speech the Princess went and asked
for them at the King&rsquo;s hand. At that time the King having said,
&ldquo;For the Turtle what horses! what swords!&rdquo; became angry at
the Princess. The Princess having become grieved, told the Turtle that
her father the King will not give them.</p>
<p>After that, having said, &ldquo;Asking for an old mare and a short
sword, come [with them],&rdquo; he sent her yet [another] time. After
that, he gave her an old mare and a short sword. Having given them,
after she brought them to the Turtle&rsquo;s house, to the Princess the
Turtle says, &ldquo;Pull creepers, and having placed me on the back of
the mare, twine them [round me and the mare].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Princess having pulled creepers, wrapped [them round
him on the mare]. Having wrapped them, making [the mare] bound he went
somewhat far; and having come out of the turtle-shell, the Prince (as
he now was), taking the lute, played the lute for the Virgin Women to
come. Then the Virgin Women came.</p>
<p>After they came, because those Princes went in white clothes on the
backs of white horses, this Prince said, &ldquo;You must bring and give
me very speedily an excellent<a class="noteref" id="n350.1src" href=
"#n350.1" name="n350.1src">6</a> horse, and a white dress, and an
excellent<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n350.1">6</a> sword.&rdquo;
Thereupon with that speed they brought and gave them.</p>
<p>After they gave them, the Prince, having tied the old mare at a
tree, putting on the [dress and] ornaments they brought, mounted on the
back of the white horse. Having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351"
href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span>gone to a very large open
place, and placed (that is, hung from his shoulder) the bag called
Kokka, he thought, &ldquo;A great number of all quadrupeds must
assemble together in my presence.&rdquo; After that, all the quadrupeds
that were in the midst of that forest, the whole having come, collected
together.</p>
<p>Without those six Princes meeting with any animal whatever, they
approached near the Prince who had collected these quadrupeds together.
Having arrived and said, &ldquo;O Lord, where is Your Majesty going in
the midst of this forest?&rdquo; [the Princes], having paid reverence
to him, made obeisance.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince says, indeed, &ldquo;I am the person who
exercises sovereignty over the whole of the wild animals in the midst
of this forest. Where are ye fellows going?&rdquo; he asked
falsely.</p>
<p>At that time these six Princes said thus regarding it, &ldquo;O
Lord, we six persons came hunting; we did not meet with any animal
whatever,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>Thereupon this Prince says thus, &ldquo;To you six persons I will
give six deer should you cut off and give [me] six [pieces] of your
cloths,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thereupon having cut and given six pieces from the six cloths which
the six Princes had been wearing, killing six deer they came away.</p>
<p>Having allowed the party to come, this Prince descended from the
back of the horse, and catching a rat and having killed it, brought it
home; having come and having crept into the turtle-shell, he says thus
[to his wife], &ldquo;Give a half from this rat to your father the
King, and cook the other piece for us two,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>At that time the Princess doing thus, went and gave a half to the
King. Thereupon the King having become angry at it, put her also
outside the [palace] gate. The Princess, feeling (<i>lit.</i>,
bringing) vexation at it, having come weeping and weeping, the two
cooked and ate the other half.</p>
<p>In this way, six days they went hunting. On the whole of the six
days the Turtle also having gone, gave hunting-meat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span>to
those six Princes, taking the jewelled rings from their fingers, ears,
and the hairs of the head; all these when the seventh day was coming
were finished.</p>
<p>What of this Prince&rsquo;s acting with so much ability! That he is
a Prince even yet any person you like has no knowledge.</p>
<p>At the time when he is thus, having gone hunting and finished, on
the seventh day making ready an eating like a very great feast they
remained at the royal palace with the Kings [who had come for it].
Thereupon, on that day this Turtle was minded to bathe. Having become
so minded, he told [his wife] to warm and give him water; having told
her to give it, he told her to tie and give him mats also, round about
[as a screen].</p>
<p>That day the Princess had boiled and boiled paddy at the hearth in
the open space in front of the house. Having warmed water and tied the
mats, she gave [it to him] to bathe. Having given it, this Princess
went to light the fire [afresh] at the paddy hearth. When she was
going, this Prince having gone to bathe, and having come out of the
turtle-shell [within the screen], went outside from the place where the
mats were tied, for the purpose of lowering water over his body.</p>
<p>When he was going, this Princess having seen that he was a Prince,
went running, and taking the turtle shell put it on the hearth at which
she boiled that paddy. Thereupon the Prince having gone crying out, got
only the lute that was in the turtle shell. The turtle shell burnt
away.</p>
<p>At that time the Prince, decorating himself, went to the royal
palace. After he went he began to relate the manner in which he gave
hunting-meat to the six Princes. While telling it he showed the [rings
from the] fingers, ears, and hair, and the pieces of cloth of the six
Princes.</p>
<p>After he showed them, [the King], having given the sovereignty to
the Prince, made the other Princes servants of the Prince. He married
those six Princesses also to that very Prince.</p>

<p class="first">In <i>The Story of Madana K&#257;ma R&#257;ja</i>
(Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;), p. 141, a tortoise (turtle)
Prince went to the Sun in search of divine P&#257;rij&#257;ta flowers;
see vol. i, p. 71. The Queen bore the turtle and the Minister&rsquo;s
wife the girl. The Minister refused to agree to their marriage, but the
girl told him that she had vowed to marry whoever brought the divine
flowers. The Apsaras who gave him the flowers also presented him with a
<i lang="si-latn">v&#299;n&#257;</i>, or lute, playing on which would
summon her. From the first sage who showed him the way and who opened
his eyes at each watch he got a magic cudgel in exchange for it, from
the second sage who opened his eyes after two watches a purse which
supplied everything required, from the third sage who opened his eyes
after three watches he received magic sandals which would transport
their wearer wherever desired. After exchanging the lute for each of
these articles he recovered it each time by the aid of the cudgel.
Afterwards he left the articles with the Apsaras, returned as a turtle
with the flowers, and was married to the Minister&rsquo;s daughter.
After his marriage the husbands of his sisters-in-law went hunting, the
turtle followed tied on the back of a horse, got his club from a banyan
tree where he had hidden it, went to the hunt on the magic sandals, and
got from his brothers-in-law (who thought him &#346;iva) the tips of
their little fingers and their rings. On regaining his Prince&rsquo;s
form he produced these, but the brothers-in-law were not punished. His
wife broke the turtle shell when he was bathing, and in the end he
succeeded to the throne.</p>
<p>In <i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. iv, p. 54, in a Bengal story by
Mr. G. H. Damant, a Prince went in search of a beautiful woman seen in
a dream by his father. An ascetic told him of five heavenly nymphs who
came to bathe in a pool at the full moon, and instructed him to take
their clothes and remain concealed. After being cursed and turned to
ashes he was revived by the ascetic, again carried off their clothes,
and sat in &#346;iva&rsquo;s temple. They cursed him ineffectively and
then agreed that he should marry one of them. He selected the ugliest,
who was the disguised beauty; she gave him a flute by means of which he
could summon her at any time. The rest of the story is unlike the
Sinhalese one.</p>
<p>In Mr. Thornhill&rsquo;s <i>Indian Fairy Tales</i>, p. 15, a Prince
went in search of his wife, an Apsaras who had left him, to a sage who
slept six months at a time, and after attending on him for three months
was accompanied by him to the pool in which the Apsarases bathed on the
full moon night. After being once turned to ashes and revived by the
sage, he again stole his wife&rsquo;s shawl and escaped with it to the
sage&rsquo;s hut, where he was safe. The Apsarases then agreed to give
up his wife if he could select her. He picked out the ugliest, and
Indra afterwards turned her into a mortal.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i> (Swynnerton), p. 343, a
Prince secreted the feather dress of one of four fairies who, in the

garden. She was then unable to fly away, and he married her.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. ii, p. 452, a person who was in search of his master, a Prince,
was advised by a hermit to carry off the clothes of one of the heavenly
nymphs who came to bathe in a river. He did so, was followed by her,
and the hermit agreed to return her garments on her giving information
of the Prince&rsquo;s whereabouts; she afterwards became the
ascetic&rsquo;s wife. She is termed a Vidy&#257;dhar&#299;.</p>
<p>In the same work, vol. ii, p. 576, a gambler by order of the God
Mah&#257;k&#257;la (Bhairava) similarly obtained a daughter of
Alambush&#257;, the Apsaras, as his wife.</p>
<p>In A. von Schiefner&rsquo;s <i>Tibetan Tales</i> (Ralston), p. 54,
by the advice of a sage a hunter threw a magic unerring chain received
from N&#257;gas, over a Kinnara Princess when she bathed at a pool at
the full moon; and she was unable to escape. She could fly only when
wearing a head-jewel.</p>
<p>The female Jinn who in the form of birds visited pools in order to
bathe in them, and could not fly without their feather dresses, have
been mentioned in vol. i, p. 311. See the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, vol.
iii, p. 417, and vol. v, p. 68. In the second story the hero obtained
in the W&#257;k Islands a cap of invisibility, and a copper rod which
gave power over seven tribes of Jinn, and by their aid recovered his
wife and sons. He got the articles by inducing two sons of a magician
to race for a stone which he threw; while they were absent he put on
the cap and disappeared. On his return journey he presented the
articles to the two magicians who had helped him.</p>
<p>In the same work, vol. iv, p. 161, a man from Cairo obtained for a
magician three magical articles, and received from him as a reward a
pair of inexhaustible saddle-bags which provided any foods.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Hindustan</i> (Shaik Chilli), p. 72, a Prince
who was wandering in search of his fairy wife received from an ascetic,
a musician, and a youth respectively, an iron rod which could beat
anyone, a guitar that entranced all, and a cap of invisibility; from a
Y&#333;g&#299; he obtained balsam for healing burns, and slippers that
transported him where desired.</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Les Avad&#257;nas</i> (Julien), No. lxxiv, vol. ii,
p. 8, each one of two demons (Pi&#347;&#257;cas) had a box which
supplied everything desired, a stick that rendered him invincible, and
a shoe that enabled the bearer to fly, and each one wanted to possess
those of the other demon. A man who offered to divide them put on both
the shoes and flew off, taking the other articles.</p>
<p>In <i>Chinese Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i> (A. M. Fielde), p. 10,
a pious man who was wrecked and cast on an island obtained food and
clothing from the inhabitants, and an apparent outcast gave him a hat
of invisibility, a cloak of flight, and a basket that when tapped
filled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span>with gems. He left them to his three sons, and
the power of the articles gradually declined.</p>
<p>At p. 58, a woman had a son encased in a chank shell, which he could
leave at will. His bride one night hid the shell, and he remained with
her for some years, until her grandmother put it out to dry. He got
into it, crawled into the sea, and disappeared.</p>
<p>In <i>Sagas from the Far East</i>, p. 148, in a Kalmuk story, an
inexhaustible bag was stolen from Dakinis (female evil spirits) by a
man. When his brother went to get one the spirits seized him, drew out
his nose to a length of five ells, and made nine knots on it.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i> (Knowles), 2nd ed., p. 365, a Prince
who worked as an under-gardener was selected by a Princess and married
to her. The King&rsquo;s sons and sons-in-law through jealousy arranged
a hunting expedition, and left him only a mare that no one could ride.
He reached the jungle first, shot a jackal, bear, and leopard, cut off
the tail, nose, and ear respectively, and when the others, who found no
game, took back these animals and showed them as their own game, he
produced his trophies. It was settled that he should succeed to the
throne.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Fairy Tales</i> (M. Stokes), p. 41, the son of the
youngest Queen, who was born with a removable monkey skin, three times
performed the task of hitting a Princess with an iron ball in his
Prince&rsquo;s form, and was married to her. After saving his life when
the sons of the other six Queens threw him out of a boat into the
water, his wife burnt his monkey skin, and he retained his human
shape.</p>
<p>At p. 130, the hunting incident is given, six Princes taking part in
it and meeting with the Prince who, while disguised as a labourer, had
been selected and married by the youngest daughter of their
father-in-law. The others found no game, begged a meal from him, and
were burnt with a red-hot pice on their backs, &ldquo;the mark of a
thief.&rdquo; The Prince rode home in his own form, and afterwards
exposed the six Princes who had mocked him on account of his low
origin.</p>
<p>At p. 156, a Prince found four fak&#299;rs quarrelling over four
articles, a flying bed, an inexhaustible bag, a bowl which yielded as
much water as was required, a stick and rope that would beat and tie up
everyone. While they raced for arrows that he shot, he got on the bed
and went off with the other things.</p>
<p>In <i>Kaffir Folk-Lore</i> (Theal), p. 170, a boy got a pair of
inexhaustible horns which when spoken to supplied everything desired.
They even provided him with a fine house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">The Story of a King and a Prince</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is partly a variant of the story No. 22, in vol.
i, called there &ldquo;The Kul&#275;-Bak&#257; Flowers.&rdquo; The
first part is a repetition of the narrative given in that one, up to
the point where the King&rsquo;s sons were imprisoned at the gambling
house. It then continues as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>The Prince who also went afterwards having gone near a widow-mother
of that very city [after] filling a bag with bits of plates, when he
said, &ldquo;Mother, a son of yours was lost before, is it not
so?&rdquo; the widow woman said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Then the Prince
while weeping falsely said, &ldquo;It is I myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, she said, weeping, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, where did you
go all this time?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11423src" href=
"#xd27e11423" name="xd27e11423src">1</a> Having gone inviting him into
the house, and given him to eat, after he finished she asked,
&ldquo;What is there in this bag, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince says falsely, &ldquo;In that bag are masuran,
mother,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The woman says, &ldquo;What are masuran to me, son! Look at that:
the heap of masuran which the King has given for my having
worked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Prince asks, &ldquo;Whose house is that,
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, at that house an
extremely wicked<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11435src" href=
"#xd27e11435" name="xd27e11435src">2</a> woman gambles. Should anyone
go to gamble she gives him golden chairs into which she puts [magical]
life, to sit upon. She has put [magical] life into the lamp also. [When
gambling], the woman is sitting upon the silver chair,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>After that, after the woman went to sleep, the Prince <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>having emptied the pieces of plate in the house,
went to gamble [after] filling the bag with the [woman&rsquo;s]
masuran.</p>
<p>Afterwards, that gambling woman just as on other days having brought
a golden chair, placed it for the Prince. Then the Prince says,
&ldquo;I am not accustomed to sit on golden chairs. Give me the silver
chair,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The woman says, &ldquo;It is not a fault to sit [on the golden
chair].&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince says, &ldquo;Having given me that silver chair here, and
put aside this lamp also, come to gamble, bringing a good lamp,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>Then the woman being unable [to effect] the punishment of the
Prince, gave him the silver chair, and bringing a different lamp sat
down to gamble. After that the Prince won. After he won he caused those
aforesaid six Princes to be brought from the place where they were put
in prison, and having burnt [their] names on their haunches,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11452src" href="#xd27e11452" name=
"xd27e11452src">3</a> sent them away.</p>
<p>After that, this Prince said he must contract marriage with that
woman who gambled. The woman says, &ldquo;If you are to marry me please
bring the S&#363;ran&#774;gan&#257; flowers.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e11458src" href="#xd27e11458" name="xd27e11458src">4</a></p>
<p>Then the Prince says, &ldquo;That is not a journey for which I came
here. The two eyes of my father the King have become blind. On account
of it I am going to seek the Kul&#275;-Bak&#257; flowers. [After]
finding them, on the return journey I will bring the
S&#363;ran&#774;gan&#257; flowers,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Having said this, he went to ask the path going to the
Kul&#275;-Bak&#257; garden. When he was going near the Yak&#257;s who
were on guard on it, a Princess whom the Yak&#257;s had seized and
carried off came up, and said to the Prince, &ldquo;What came you here
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through news that you are here I came to marry you,&rdquo;
[he replied].</p>
<p>Then the Princess says, &ldquo;Should the Yak&#257;s come they will
eat you up,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The Prince then says, &ldquo;By any possible contrivance save
me,&rdquo; he said. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358"
name="pb358">358</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Princess then opened the door of a rock house (cave), and having
taken the Prince and put him in it, shut the door.</p>
<p>After that, the Yak&#257;s having come, ask, &ldquo;Who came
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess says, &ldquo;Amm&#275;! I cannot be here [to be
questioned] in this way. Seek and give me a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Yakshan&#299; says, &ldquo;There is no seeking and
giving<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11481src" href="#xd27e11481" name=
"xd27e11481src">5</a> for me. If you can, seek and take one,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>The Princess says, &ldquo;I will find one if you will not do any
harm [to him].&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yakshan&#299; said, &ldquo;We will do no harm to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you swear by the censure of your deity, I will show you my
husband,&rdquo; she said. Afterwards she swore.</p>
<p>After she took the Prince into the light, she asks the Prince,
&ldquo;What do you eat?&rdquo; The Yakshan&#299; asks.</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I eat ripe Jak, Warak&#257; (a kind of Jak
fruit), Sugar-cane, Pine-apples.&rdquo; The Yakshan&#299; went and
brought and gave him them. Afterwards, after the Prince ate, she said,
&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince says, &ldquo;Tell me the path [by which] to go to
the Kul&#275;-Bak&#257; garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having informed him of the path, and given him also a robe [endowed]
with the power of flying through the air, she told him to go. He went
to the Kul&#275;-Bak&#257; garden, and [after] plucking the
Kul&#275;-Bak&#257; flower that was in the pool, having come, calling
the Princess, to the place where he gambled, he caused her to remain
there.</p>
<p>The Prince, taking the Kul&#275;-Bak&#257; flower, was going near
his father the King. At the time when he was going across a river those
six Princes were [there], cooking and cooking rice. Also at that very
place a rich man without his two eyes was saying and saying, &ldquo;To
a man who should cure my two eyes I will give goods [amounting] to a
tusk elephant&rsquo;s load, and also a tusk elephant.&rdquo; He was
saying and saying [this].</p>
<p>This Prince having heard it, said, &ldquo;I will give you them.
[Please] bring the presents you mentioned.&rdquo; After he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>brought them he rubbed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11505src" href="#xd27e11505" name="xd27e11505src">6</a> his eyes
with the Kul&#275;-Bak&#257; flower; after that, he succeeded in seeing
the light.</p>
<p>Those six Princes having seen it, spoke together: &ldquo;Let us beat
him, and snatch away the flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince having heard that speech, said, &ldquo;Taking this flower
for yourselves, give me a little cooked rice.&rdquo; Afterwards, taking
the flower they gave him cooked rice. Having eaten the cooked rice the
Prince came back to the place where he gambled.</p>
<p>After that, while through hunger for them he was going to seek the
S&#363;ran&#774;gan&#257; flowers, three Princes who were coming
mounted on horse-back asked this Prince, &ldquo;Where are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince says falsely, &ldquo;I am going in hunger in the
midst of this forest.&rdquo; Then a Prince having unfastened a packet
of cooked rice and given the Prince to eat, they went away.</p>
<p>As they were going, this Prince went after them very softly. Having
gone, when he looked he saw that those three Princes, having descended
from horse-back, three times turned round the d&#275;w&#257;la
(temple), and jumped into a vessel of boiling oil [and
disappeared].</p>
<p>Having seen it, this Prince also having turned round the
d&#275;w&#257;la three times, jumped into the oil vessel. After he
jumped in, the deity, bringing that Prince out of the oil vessel,
covered him with a white cloth when he had struck [him] three blows
with a white wand. After he arose, when he asked, &ldquo;What is the
matter for which thou camest here?&rdquo; [the Prince replied],
&ldquo;I came in order to seek and take S&#363;ran&#774;gan&#257;
flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the deity told him the path:&mdash;&ldquo;Look there. When you
are going along that path [you will meet with a pool. When she has put
her cloth on the bank and is bathing], take the cloth of the woman who
comes after three others to bathe in the pool, and come back [with
it],&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, he took the cloth, and came. Afterwards <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name="pb360">360</a>]</span>that
Princess having come running, gave him a chank shell into which she had
put [magical] life, and taking the cloth went away.</p>
<p>When he was coming taking the chank shell, an ascetic begged for the
chank shell. The Prince says, &ldquo;If you will give me presents I
will give you the chank shell,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, he gave him a wallet (<i lang=
"si-latn">ol&#333;-payiya</i>), assuring him that the things thought of
will come into existence [in it]. After he gave it, the Prince,
thinking of the things he wanted (the celestial flowers), put his hand
into it, and when he looked they were inside the wallet.</p>
<p>After that, the Prince, having become satisfied, with pleasure went
away [and rejoined his two wives].</p>

<p class="first">See the <a href="#s151n">Notes</a> appended to the
previous story.</p>
<p>In <i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. iii, p. 150, in a legend of the
origin of Patn&#257;, by Mr. Basanta Kumar Ningi, two R&#257;kshasas
came to a boy with three articles left by their father, out of which he
cheated them. One was a bag from which all kinds of jewels could be
extracted when the hand was inserted. The story is stated to be from
the <i lang="sa-latn">B&#7771;ihat Kath&#257;</i>. In the <i lang=
"sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney), vol. i, p. 13,
they were the sons of the Asura Maya, and were wrestling for the
things. The boy suggested that they should race for them and while they
were doing so he put on the magic shoes which were included in them,
and disappeared with the staff and the vessel which supplied any
required food.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i> (Knowles), 2nd ed., p. 378, a
shipwrecked Prince arrived at a cave which was the residence of a
R&#257;kshasa who had carried off a Princess, and who kept her there.
She received him well, and hid him in a strong box. When the
R&#257;kshasa returned he smelt the man, and insisted on being shown
him; but the brave behaviour of the Prince pleased him, and he
permitted him to live in the cave, and brought presents for the two
when he returned from his expeditions in search of prey. As they still
feared he might eat them, the Princess managed to ascertain from him
that his life was in a queen-bee in a honey-comb which could be reached
by anyone who sat on a magic stool that was in the cave, which
transported the sitter where he wished. Next day, when the
R&#257;kshasa was absent, the Prince wrapped himself up, smashed the
comb, crushed and killed the bee, the R&#257;kshasa died, and they
escaped on the stool. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href=

<h2 class="main">The Story of the Gourd</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Queen of the King of Maeda Maha-Nuwara being
without children, seven years went by. To obtain children she gave
alms-halls (<i lang="si-latn">dan-sael</i>). Having given them she
obtained a child.</p>
<p>It was [necessary] for the King to go for a war. In sorrow for it,
having called together women who assist [at child-birth], and many
people, he gave them [to the Queen]. On his return journey she had not
borne a child. On the very day on which he came, pains having seized
her she gave birth [to a Gourd].</p>
<p>The women who were there, having taken the Gourd which this Queen
bore, in order to throw it away at another city took the Gourd to a
flower garden at the city, and put it there.</p>
<p>When the garland-making mother (<i lang="si-latn">mal-k&#257;ra
amm&#257;</i>) went to pluck flowers, &ldquo;May I also pluck
flowers?&rdquo; the Gourd asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you, Gourd, pluck flowers?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does not matter to you; I will pluck flowers. I must go
to the garland-making mother&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; it said.</p>
<p>Having gone [there], &ldquo;I will plait flower chaplets (<i lang=
"si-latn">malwadan</i>),&rdquo; it said. To plait the chaplets it asked
for the thread and needle. Better than the plaiting of the flower
chaplets on other days it plaited the flower chaplets, and gave
them.</p>
<p>Having seen [the beauty of] the flower chaplets [when the flower
mother took them to the palace], the Princess asked, &ldquo;Who plaited
the flower chaplets to-day?&rdquo; she asked; [she was informed that
the Gourd did it]. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362"
name="pb362">362</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Gourd was minded to contract marriage with the young Queen
(Princess). It asked the King of the city [to give his consent].
&ldquo;If the Queen (Princess)<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11605src"
href="#xd27e11605" name="xd27e11605src">1</a> is willing I am
willing,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>[When it asked the Princess, she said], &ldquo;Having carried
upstairs gold from the house of the garland-making mother, should you
tie up [as a decoration] cloths [worked] with gold, in the morning I
will celebrate the wedding festival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning the Gourd went upstairs. It having gone [with the
gold and hung up the cloths], the wedding festival was celebrated.</p>
<p>The Gourd laughs at its contracting (<i>lit.</i>, tying) the
marriage with the young Queen. Through shame at it, grief was produced
in her. When she asked for a medicine for [the illness caused by] the
grief, they said, &ldquo;Should you eat the flesh of the Fish (<i lang=
"si-latn">mastay&#257;</i>) in the midst of the sea, and the fat, you
will be cured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[The King] having constructed six ships for the six Princes [the
brothers of the Princess], told them to go to bring the Fish. The Gourd
also at that time said [to the Princess], &ldquo;Ask [for permission]
for me also to go.&rdquo; [She asked her father accordingly].</p>
<p>Regarding that the King said, &ldquo;The Gourd itself will apply
medical treatment!&rdquo; Having said it he gave it a broken-legged
horse and a piece of broken sword.</p>
<p>Taking them, it went near a B&#333; tree, and having tied the horse
at the tree, [and assumed a human shape], put on clothes [taken] from a
hollow in the B&#333; tree, and went away from the palace. The Gourd,
[now a Prince], says, &ldquo;The God &#346;akra (Indra) is I
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The six persons for whom the ships were constructed and given, went
away [on the sea, in search of the Fish]. When [the Gourd Prince] told
those six persons [to catch the Fish], the whole six on one side tried
to take it, [but failed].</p>
<p>They having said, &ldquo;We cannot take it,&rdquo; he asked,
&ldquo;For me to take and give you it, what mark am I to make on
you?&rdquo; [They came to terms, and he caught the Fish]. Having
stretched out the tongues of the six persons he cut <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=
"pb363">363</a>]</span>them, and they gave him their jewelled
finger-rings. When they brought from the Gourd [Prince] and gave [the
Princess] the flesh and fat [of the Fish] the illness was cured.</p>
<p>[As the six Princes claimed to have caught the Fish themselves, the
Prince, who had left his clothes at the B&#333; tree and had again
taken the form of the Gourd], caused many persons to be brought, and
told them to stretch out and look at the tongues of these six persons.
[It also produced their finger-rings as proof that it was the Gourd who
had caught the Fish]. Having shown that the tongues of the six persons
were cut, the Gourd, having employed the servants, [made them] cut open
the Gourd.</p>
<p>[The God &#346;akra then rose out of it in his Prince&rsquo;s form,
and said,] &ldquo;I am not [of] the things conceived in a womb. Because
for the god &#346;akra that is impure, having created the Gourd I was
born [in it]. As there was deficiency of merit for our father the King,
I [thus] caused it to be cast away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Probably he then returned to Indral&#333;ka, his divine world, but
the narrator omitted to state this. There were many other omissions at
which it will be seen that I have endeavoured to supply the necessary
words).</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a Gamar&#257;la and a
Gama-mahan&#774;g&#275; (his wife), it is said. The children of those
two are two sons and a daughter. The big son one day having worked a
rice field, at noon came home for food. The Gama-mahan&#774;g&#275; was
a little late in giving the food. The son quarrelled [with her] over
it. That day at night the Gama-mahan&#774;g&#275; spoke to the
Gamar&#257;la that he must bring and give an assistant (a wife) to the
son.</p>
<p>On the next day the Gamar&#257;la having gone to seek a girl, while
he was going asking and asking from village to village, in even a
single place he did not meet with a girl.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Gamar&#257;la having come to the village, when he was
there a considerable time, again the son of the Gamar&#257;la
quarrelled with the Gama-mahan&#774;g&#275;. While he was quarrelling,
the Gamar&#257;la and the Gama-mahan&#774;g&#275;, both of them, said,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thou stay making and making quarrels here. Go to any
place thou wantest.&rdquo; Afterwards the son went somewhere or other.
The other younger son is going for rice-field work.</p>
<p>For that elder brother who went away the younger sister had much
affection. Because of it, from the day on which the elder brother went
away this younger sister through grief does not eat. Having said,
&ldquo;Without seeing our elder brother I cannot remain,&rdquo; she is
weeping.</p>
<p>Then the younger elder brother says, &ldquo;Why, younger sister? I
am [here]; is that insufficient for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the younger sister says, &ldquo;Why, elder brother, are you
saying thus? If two persons give me more assistance than the assistance
of one person, how good it is for me!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span></p>
<p>Afterwards, that elder brother one day having gone to the rice
field, at the time when he was chopping the earthen ridges (<i lang=
"si-latn">niyara</i>) met with a Shell Snail (<i lang=
"si-latn">golu-bellek</i>). Having brought the Snail home, and given it
into the hand of the younger sister, he said, &ldquo;There, younger
sister! I brought for you a small round-backed elder brother. Because
of it, don&rsquo;t you be sorrowful now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, that younger sister, taking the Snail, having wrapped it
in a cloth and placed it in a box, put it away. Having put it away,
three times a day having taken the Snail and looked at it, she says,
&ldquo;Our two parents having quarrelled with our elder brother drove
him away. On account of it our little elder brother brought you and
gave you to me. Owing to it [also], little round-backed elder brother,
there is grief in my mind.&rdquo; She having said and said [this], and
every day having said thus when putting it away, one day the
Gamar&#257;la stayed listening.</p>
<p>Having been listening he says at the hand of the
Gama-mahan&#774;g&#275;, &ldquo;What, Bolan, is this thing that our
girl is saying? You also come and listen.&rdquo; Then the
Gama-mahan&#774;g&#275; having come and been listening, the two persons
spoke together, &ldquo;It is through grief, indeed, that her elder
brother is not [here]. There is no need to say anything about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, while the girl in that manner for a considerable time is
saying and saying thus to the Shell Snail, one day when the girl is
saying so again, the snail shell having burst open a Prince was born
looking like a sun or a moon.</p>
<p>After that, the girl having thrown away the bits of shell into which
the snail shell burst, bathed the Prince, and took him. Having sent
milk into a finger for the Prince, he continued to drink milk from her
finger. When he was there no long time a tale-bearer told the King that
there was a very good [looking] Prince at the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s
house. Afterwards the King having sent Ministers caused them to look.
The Ministers having looked and having gone, told the King, &ldquo;The
Prince, indeed, is the royal Prince sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the King gave permission<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11697src" href="#xd27e11697" name="xd27e11697src">1</a> for
summoning the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>Prince and the mother who was rearing the Prince
to come to the palace. After that, the Ministers having gone to the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house brought the Prince and the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s girl to the palace.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the King taking charge of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s girl
and the Prince, when for the Prince the age of about twelve years was
filled up, the King died. Having appointed the Prince to the
sovereignty he remained ruling the kingdom with the ten kingly
virtues.</p>

<p class="first">The feeding of a Prince from the finger is found in
the <i lang="sa-latn">Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata</i> (Dr&#333;&#7751;a

M&#257;ndh&#257;t&#7771;i, who made his appearance in the world out of
his father&rsquo;s left side, as a consequence of the latter&rsquo;s
having drunk some sacrificial butter or gh&#299;, which had the magic
property of causing the birth of a son. The food thus provided was so
nourishing that the infant grew to twelve cubits in as many days. In A.

not fed thus, but was suckled by the eighty thousand wives of his
father, having been born from a tumour on the crown of the King&rsquo;s

<p class="first">A certain Gamar&#257;la had two daughters and two
sons. During the time when they were [there], the elder sister and the
younger sister go to the pansala to make flower offerings. Having gone,
the younger sister when making the flower offering wishes, &ldquo;May I
receive wealth,&rdquo; she says. The elder sister when making the
flower offering wished, &ldquo;May I succeed in eating the bodies of
the relatives whom there are of mine.&rdquo; The younger sister does
not mention the form in which she wishes this wish.</p>
<p>When there is a little time [gone] in this manner, having spoken
about a marriage for the big daughter, the wedding was [made] ready. It
having taken place, they went calling her to another village. Having
gone, after a little time had gone the woman began to eat the men of
that city. Having eaten and eaten them, after the men of the city were
finished she ate also the husband who married<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11734src" href="#xd27e11734" name="xd27e11734src">2</a> her.
Belonging to him a female child was born. Keeping the child, without
anyone of the city being with the woman she was alone.</p>
<p>Then her father came. That day night, having given him amply to eat
and drink,&mdash;there was a house<a class="noteref" id="n367.3src"
href="#n367.3" name="n367.3src">3</a> adjoining the house<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n367.3">3</a> in which she is; in the direction
of the house in which she is, between that house and this house the
wall <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>was closed with coconut leaves,&mdash;in the
house she allowed her father who came, to sleep at night. Having given
it she said, &ldquo;Father, at this village is much small-pox. The men
of this village and my husband were lost [by it]. Having been lost,
[while] so much time was passing you did not remember me. It happened
that you did not want me; you have wanted only younger sister. It is
good. What am I to do?&rdquo; Having said [this] she wept a
weeping.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11752src" href="#xd27e11752" name=
"xd27e11752src">4</a></p>
<p>Thereupon the old man says, &ldquo;No, daughter, I have been ill.
Because of it, indeed, I did not succeed in coming,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>In that manner having said false words, having been weeping and
weeping, she told him to sleep in the house beyond the house in which
she is, and having spread mats gave them. Having given them she said,
&ldquo;Father, don&rsquo;t you be afraid; I also, so long a time,
remained alone, indeed, with this child,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>This woman also, having come away, lay down.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11764src" href="#xd27e11764" name="xd27e11764src">5</a> Having
been lying down, after her father went to sleep this woman brought a
stick, and having beaten and killed him, during that night ate that man
also.</p>
<p>Owing to that man&rsquo;s being missing, his son came. Him, also, in
that very way she ate. His younger brother also came; him, also, she
ate in that manner.</p>
<p>Owing to the three persons, the persons who went, not coming, both
[the father&rsquo;s] wife and younger daughter went. When they went,
says this woman, &ldquo;An&#275;! Mother, the men of this city, and
father who came from there also, and both younger brothers and all,
died. Keeping this girl, I am alone in this village. From anyone of
you, at any time whatever, there will not be assistance [for me]. I
said you will come; since yesterday I have been expecting you,&rdquo;
and weeping she went in front of her mother and younger sister.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having gone and talked, she allowed the two persons to sit in
another house. Having allowed them to sit in it, she made ready and
gave food and drink, and having allowed those two persons to lie down,
she told them to go to sleep. She also having gone lay down.</p>
<p>What though she allowed this mother and daughter to sleep! In the
mind of that younger sister of hers is that formerly wished word when
making the flower offering. Owing to that circumstance she remained
during that day and night without sleep. Her mother, snoring and
snoring, was sleeping well.</p>
<p>Having heard the snoring, this human-flesh-eating woman, taking also
the men-killing party, came in order to kill and eat these two persons.
When [they were] coming there, that girl cried out, &ldquo;Elder
sister, a dog came,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Then this girl having gone into the house, and having been in the
house, at the time of her coming half closing the door, said,
&ldquo;Ci, Ci, dog!&rdquo; and came crying out. In this way [the elder
sister] came two or three times. What of her coming! She was unable to
eat them.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11783src" href="#xd27e11783" name=
"xd27e11783src">6</a></p>
<p>In this manner the girl having been awake, at the watch when it
becomes light came calling her mother, and they began to run away. At
the time when they were going this human-flesh-eating
R&#257;kshas&#299; awoke. Having awoke, when she looked she got to know
that these two persons have gone. Ascertaining it, that woman, learning
that they had done this very trick, began to run [after them]. At the
time when she was going running she met with these two persons. When
meeting with them that girl cried out. While [she was] coming, when the
big woman looked [back], having seen that this one is running [after
them] she became stone there.</p>
<p>That girl began to run [off alone]. That R&#257;kshas&#299; having
eaten the point of the stone which her mother had become, when she
looked that girl was running off. Because she was unable to eat the
stone she bounded on the girl&rsquo;s path. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span>When
she was going bounding [on it], at the root of an In&#774;di (wild
date) tree the door of a rock house opened. After that, this Princess
crept into the rock house [and the door closed again]. After that, the
R&#257;kshas&#299; who became a demon went away.</p>
<p>Then, when a King, the Ministers, and gentlemen (<i lang=
"si-latn">mah&#257;ttay&#333;</i>) came walking, [the King] said a
four-line verse. When he was saying it, this Princess who was in the
rock house at the root of the In&#774;di tree also said a four-line
verse. Then anger having come to the King, he said, &ldquo;There! Who
is the person who said that four-line verse? Look and seek,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Thereupon, when the party sought and looked, anyone you like was not
there. The party having gone back, and come to the King, told him,
&ldquo;O Lord, Your Majesty, we sought and looked everywhere; we indeed
are unable to find her,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>After that, the King said yet a four-line verse. To that also the
Princess, being in the rock, said a four-line verse. At that time,
also, he told the Ministers to seek; on that occasion, too, they could
not find her. On that occasion, also, having come to the King, they
said, &ldquo;O Lord, Your Majesty, we this time also looked; we indeed
are unable to find her,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>After that, the King having gone near the spot where she said the
four-line verse, said yet also a four-line verse. When [he was] saying
it, having been very near under the ground she said a four-line verse.
Then the King asks, &ldquo;Did a Yak&#257;, or a Yaksan&#299;, or a
Deity, or a D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; (Godling) say that four-line verse?
You must inform me to-day,&rdquo; the King said.</p>
<p>Then the Princess who is in the rock house at the root of the
In&#774;di tree, said, &ldquo;I am not a Yak&#257;, and not a Deity,
and not a D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257;; I am a human being. Who speaks
outside there I cannot ascertain. Because of it you must tell me who it
is,&rdquo; the Princess who is in the rock house at the root of the
In&#774;di tree said.</p>
<p>Then the King says, &ldquo;I am not a Yak&#257;. Me indeed they call
the King of this city,&rdquo; the King said. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, is the truth the contrary, is the truth the
contrary?&rdquo; three times she asked.</p>
<p>The King also assured her of his kingly state. After that the stone
door of the rock house at the root of the In&#774;di tree opened. After
it opened, having seen that the Queen was there, possessing a figure
endowed with much beauty, to the degree that he was unable to look [at
her], the King was minded to marry her. Having been so minded, placing
her on the back of the tusk elephant he went to the city at which he
stayed.</p>
<p>Having gone [there, and married her], when a little time was going a
child was conceived (<i lang="si-latn">uppann&#257;ya</i>) in the
Queen&rsquo;s womb. When it was conceived, because the city in which
she stayed was a solitary city (<i lang="si-latn">tani nuwara</i>) in
that country there was no midwife-mother. Because of it, when going
through the middle of the jungle in order to proceed to yet [another]
city, [she and the King arrived at an abandoned city].</p>
<p>Having arrived, this King walked around the city, and when he looked
about, from one house, only, he saw that smoke goes. Having seen it he
went to the house, and when he looked a woman and the woman&rsquo;s
little girl were [there]. After that, this woman saw that the King is
going. Having seen him she asked at the King&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;Lord,
where is Your Majesty going?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;The Queen of the rock house at the root
of the In&#774;di tree having married me, she is with a child. For it
there being no midwife, I came to seek one,&rdquo; the King said.</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshasa-goblin<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11830src"
href="#xd27e11830" name="xd27e11830src">7</a> got into her mind,
&ldquo;What of my younger sister&rsquo;s being hidden that day indeed!
To-day I shall eat her.&rdquo; Thinking [this], this
woman-R&#257;kshas&#299; said, &ldquo;Maharaja, I well know midwifery.
Regarding that indeed, why will you go to another place and become
wearied?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The King having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; on hearing her word
went summoning her.</p>
<p>On the very day she went, in the night pains seized the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span>Queen of the rock house at the root of the
In&#774;di tree. She went to the place where they were seizing her.
When she went that Queen got to know that she came in order to eat her.
Although ascertaining it she did not mention it to the King.</p>
<p>Well then, [the R&#257;kshas&#299;] having come, during the night
she bore [a child]. After she bore [the child] that R&#257;kshas&#299;
ate all the after-birth (<i lang="si-latn">waed&#363;-mas</i>) that was
there. The Queen did not tell that also to the King.</p>
<p>Well then, having finished (<i lang="si-latn">nim&#257;&#7693;u
wel&#257;</i>) at the parturition house (<i lang=
"si-latn">waed&#363;-ge[yi]n</i>), during that night [the Queen] went
to sleep. After she went to sleep, lifting up the child and the Queen
with the bed on which they were sleeping, this R&#257;kshas&#299;
during the night began to go away. When going this Queen awoke. Having
awoke, when going under trees she broke and broke dead sticks, and put
them into the bed for weight to be caused (<i lang=
"si-latn">bara-gaehen&#7693;a</i>). On her placing them [there], when
the bed is being made heavy the R&#257;kshas&#299; says, &ldquo;It is
good; make it heavy. What of my being unable to eat you, you having
crept into the rock house at the root of the In&#774;di tree!&rdquo;
Saying and saying, &ldquo;To-day indeed I shall eat you,&rdquo;
disputing and disputing with her she went along.</p>
<p>When she was going thus, a banyan branch had bent down to the path;
on the banyan branch this Queen hung. This R&#257;kshas&#299; went on,
carrying simply the bed. Having gone, having put the bed on the ground,
when she looked the Queen was not on the bed.</p>
<p>Afterwards she came bounding again very near this banyan tree. This
one ascertained that unless [the Queen] goes near the banyan tree, she
is unable to go by another place. Ascertaining it, and having gone on
and on among the branches and among the leaves in the tree, saying and
saying, &ldquo;I will eat thee, I will eat thee,&rdquo; she began to
walk about. Although she is walking about that Queen is not visible
through the power of the resolution of the Gods.</p>
<p>Then, on the morning of the following day, when [the King] looked
this Queen is not [present]. Afterwards the King, together with the
Ministers, for the purpose of seeking <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb373" href="#pb373" name="pb373">373</a>]</span>the Queen having
entered the jungle forest wilderness, when going away to seek her, in
the midst of the forest, near a leafy banyan tree they heard a sound of
a human voice, &ldquo;I will eat thee, I will eat thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they look what affair this is, the King&rsquo;s Queen and the
child are in the tree. That R&#257;kshas&#299; having said [to herself]
that this King will cut her down, ran off through fear.</p>
<p>The King asked the royal Queen, &ldquo;By what means came you
here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Then the Queen said, &ldquo;The midwife-mother came lifting my child
and me with the bed, in order to eat me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King having taken the Queen and gone, and having
sent her to the palace, made a bonfire (<i>lit.</i>, fire-heap) in the
midst of the wilderness, and set fire to it. Having set fire to it,
when the smoke was going that R&#257;kshas&#299; having walked [there]
asked, &ldquo;Regarding what circumstance is [this done]?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>When she was asking the King said, &ldquo;The Queen of the rock
house at the root of the In&#774;di tree having died, we are making the
tomb for her relics (<i lang="si-latn">d&#257; sohon</i>),&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>As soon as he says it,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11883src" href=
"#xd27e11883" name="xd27e11883src">8</a> having said, &ldquo;An&#275;!
If I did not eat a little flesh from my younger sister to-day, what am
I living for?&rdquo; she sprang into the blazing heap; having sprung
[into it] she died. The King after that, together with the Queen,
remained in happiness.</p>
<p>Because through fear on the day when the stone door at the root of
the In&#774;di tree opened, she sprang into the house, and having been
there was married to the King, she kept the name, &ldquo;The Queen of
the Rock House at the root of the In&#774;di tree.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This story contains references to several notions that
are still preserved in the villages, such as the fulfilment of wishes,
either silent or expressed aloud, when presenting offerings at the
wih&#257;ras, the protection of human beings by the personal
intervention of guardian deities, and the existence of internal
apartments in certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href=
"#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>rock masses. A high rounded hill
of gneiss is pointed out at N&#299;rammulla, in the North-western
Province,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11898src" href="#xd27e11898" name=
"xd27e11898src">9</a> inside which King V&#299;ra-B&#257;hu is stated
to have constructed a palace; and many flat rocks which emit a hollow
sound when trodden on are supposed to contain such an apartment or
&ldquo;house&rdquo; as that mentioned in this tale. The belief that a
human being may become a demon before death is, I think, not now held;
but in the J&#257;taka story No. 321 (vol. iii, p. 48) a wicked boy
became a <i lang="si-latn">pr&#275;ta</i> &ldquo;while still
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Examples of the wishes made on presenting religious offerings are to
be seen in the J&#257;taka stories Nos. 514, 527, and 531. In <i lang=
"fr">Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol. ii, p. 137,
it is stated, &ldquo;Thus, when one pronounces a wish in the name of
acts productive of goodness that one has effected, the realisation
depends solely on the heart and good fortune; whatever may be the mark
at which one aims there is no one who does not attain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <i>Tales of the Sun</i> (Mrs. H. Kingscote and Pandit
Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;), p. 220, a girl who was being
carried off by robbers while on her cot, escaped like the Queen in this
story.</p>
<p>In <i>Tales of the Punjab</i> (Mrs. F. A. Steel), p. 227, the same
incident is found, the person who escaped being the wife of a barber,
whom thieves were carrying off. In this case she did not first increase
the load on the bed by branches or fruits. (See also vol. i, p.
357.)</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Fairy Tales</i> (M. Stokes), p. 140, a Prince who was
going in search of a magic B&#275;l fruit was instructed by a
fak&#299;r how to take it, and was warned that if he looked back while
returning, he and his horse would be turned into stone. This occurred,
and nothing was then done to them by the fairies and demons who were
chasing them. Afterwards the fak&#299;r found them, cut his little
finger from the tip to the palm, smeared the blood from it on the
Prince&rsquo;s forehead and on the horse, prayed to God, and they
became alive again.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. i, p. 210, the son of a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a smashed with a lighted
piece of wood the skull of a person who was being burnt in a funeral
pyre in a cemetery. Some of the brain flew out and entered his open
mouth, and he immediately became a R&#257;kshasa.</p>
<p>In the same work, vol. ii, p. 578, an Apsaras who was the wife of a
gambler was by a curse of Indra&rsquo;s turned into an image
(apparently a wooden or stone relief) on a pillar in a temple. The
Jewish legend of Lot&rsquo;s wife shows that the notion of such
transformations, especially when a person disobeyed an injunction not
to look back, was of very ancient date.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i> (Knowles), 2nd ed., pp. 191 ff.,
four Princes were changed into stones by a J&#333;g&#299;, or Hindu
ascetic. In a footnote, p. 192, Mr. Knowles gives references to such
metamorphoses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=
"pb375">375</a>]</span>elsewhere, among them being the turning of a
hunter into stone<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11941src" href=
"#xd27e11941" name="xd27e11941src">10</a> owing to a curse by
Damayant&#299;. Mr. Knowles states that many stones in Kashm&#299;r are
believed to be the petrified bodies of men who have been cursed. I do
not remember seeing or hearing of any instances of such petrifaction in
Ceylon, but we may gather from the story just given and that numbered
136 that such a belief is held there.</p>
<p>In the same work, pp. 401&ndash;403, there is an account of two
Princes who went in search of a wonderful bird, and were changed into
stone when they turned back in alarm. Their younger brother was more
successful, and got a pot of magic water, which when sprinkled on his
brothers and on many other stones lying on the ground, caused them to
resume their human state.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales from an Eastern Forest</i> (W. Skeat), p. 67, it is
remarked that the Malays believe that there were once numerous gigantic
spirits who could transform people whom they addressed by name into
wood or stone.</p>
<p>In the Preface to <i>The Kath&#257;ko&ccedil;a</i>, p. xiii, Mr.
Tawney quoted Dr. B&uuml;hler&rsquo;s words regarding the Jain belief
in animism,&mdash;that souls are to be found &ldquo;in apparently
lifeless masses, in stone, in clods of earth, in drops of water, in
fire and in wind&rdquo;&mdash;and mentions that as far as he knew, the
Jains stand alone in this belief. Nevertheless, in the cases of
Ahaly&#257; and Rambh&#257;, and the Apsaras of the <i lang=
"sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i>,&mdash;who, while she was in
the form of an image or relief, shed tears on seeing her
husband,&mdash;as well as in the examples in the other
folk-tales,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11965src" href="#xd27e11965"
name="xd27e11965src">11</a> the notion appears to be that the soul or
spirit continued to exist in the petrified body, which was ready to
return to its original state as soon as some necessary occurrence took
place, whether a sprinkling of charmed water which neutralised the
former spell, or the termination of a period fixed by a curse, or
otherwise. We can perhaps see further evidence of the existence of the
same belief in India and Ceylon in the stone statues of guardian
deities, such as Bhairava, N&#257;gas, Yakshas, and R&#257;kshasas,
carved at religious edifices; they, as well as the figures in the
Euphrates Valley and Egypt, appear to have been thought to act as
protectors because, although formed of stone, a soul existed in them,
that is, so far as evil spirits were concerned they were living stones,
and not mere scarecrows.</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol.
iii, p. 219, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span>there is an account of the death and burial of a
Prince aged fifteen, whose soul remained in his body afterwards. When a
pine tree which had been planted over the grave sent down a root that
reached his heart, the soul became alarmed, climbed up the root, and
lodged among the leaves of the tree. It had other adventures.</p>
<p>In the <i>Arabian Nights</i> (Lady Burton&rsquo;s ed., vol. i, p.
145), a lady described her arrival at a city in which the King and
Queen and all the inhabitants had been transformed by Allah into black
stones, with the sole exception of the King&rsquo;s only son, a devout
Muhammadan.</p>
<p>In vol. vi of the same work, p. 121, a man arrived at a great city
in which all the inhabitants, with the exception of the royal Princess,
had been changed into stone at the prayer of a Muhammadan Prophet. In
both these instances the petrified persons were not revived.</p>
<p>See also the Notes after the last story in vol. iii.</p>
<p>In <i>Kaffir Folk-Lore</i> (Theal), p. 36, a rock opened at a
boy&rsquo;s request, and he and his sister lived in it, leaving and
returning at will. At p. 83, some boys when chased by cannibals took
refuge in a rock which &ldquo;a little man&rdquo; turned into a hut; to
the cannibals it was still a rock.</p>
<p>With regard to the remarks on the last page, two Sinhalese
histories, the <i lang="si-latn">R&#257;j&#257;valiya</i> and <i lang=
"si-latn">P&#363;j&#257;valiya</i>, give a legend which indicates a
belief that even the statues of guardian animals possessed souls. It is
recorded of King Mitta-S&#275;na (<span class="sc">A.D.</span>
435&ndash;436) that on one occasion when the state elephant was not
ready for him when he had been worshipping the Tooth-relic of Buddha,
&ldquo;the King became angry and asked whether the great elephant image
could not take him on its back. The elephant, made of tile [brick] and
mortar, approached the King, made him to sit on his back, took the King
to the city, placed him in the palace, and went away&rdquo; (<i lang=
"si-latn">R&#257;j.</i>, Gu&#7751;as&#275;kara&rsquo;s translation, p.
54).</p>
<p>It is probable that the figures of guardian animals or deities
carved only in relief, or even represented in paintings, may have been
thought to possess souls of their own&mdash;that is, to act
protectively as sentient beings.</p>
<p>It is merely a step forward to the idea in the Quatrain of wise old
Omar Khayy&#257;m:&mdash;</p>

<h2 class="main">The Story of the Elder Sister and Younger Brother</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain village there was a Gamar&#257;la. While
a woman contracting (<i>lit.</i>, tying) marriage with him was [there],
a female child and a male child were born. After they two were born the
woman died.</p>
<p>After that, for the man they again brought a woman. Because the
woman<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12035src" href="#xd27e12035" name=
"xd27e12035src">1</a> did not take notice of the children, the children
think, &ldquo;There is no advantage to us in staying here; let us leave
the country and go.&rdquo; Having said [this] they began to go.</p>
<p>While they were thus going they entered a forest jungle, and at the
time when they were proceeding in it the flowers of a K&#299;na
tree<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12042src" href="#xd27e12042" name=
"xd27e12042src">2</a> having blossomed and faded, the elder sister
picked up flowers that had fallen, and took them and smelt them.</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;These flowers are not good,&rdquo; the younger
brother went up the tree and plucked flowers. At the time when he was
descending the younger brother disappeared (<i lang=
"si-latn">naeti-wun&#257;</i>). The elder sister through grief at it
remained at the bottom of the tree.</p>
<p>While a King of the city was going hunting, having seen that the
woman is staying under the tree, the King came near and spoke [to her].
Thereupon the woman did not speak; but the King, holding her by the
hand,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12054src" href="#xd27e12054" name=
"xd27e12054src">3</a> went summoning her to the city [and married her].
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378</a>]</span></p>
<p>While staying at the city, the woman having become pregnant a child
was born. The King told her to fix a name for the child. Then also
(<i lang="si-latn">&#275;t</i>) the woman did not speak.</p>
<p>While the two persons were staying thus for a little time, again a
child was born. The King told the woman to fix a name for that child
also. Then also this woman did not speak. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
speak?&rdquo; the King asked. Then also she did not speak.</p>
<p>On yet a day, the King went hunting with the Ministers, and having
gone walking and come near the city, told the Ministers to go. The
Ministers having gone there, say at the hand of that woman, &ldquo;A
bear bit (<i>lit.</i>, ate) the King to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they are saying it falsely, the Queen, taking the two children,
and having descended from the palace to the path, and fallen on the
ground, sitting down says to the two Princes, &ldquo;Sun-rays Prince,
Moon-rays Prince, weep ye for your father; I am weeping for my younger
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King having secretly come again near the palace, remained
listening. Having seen it, the Queen, taking the two Princes, got into
(<i lang="si-latn">etul-wun&#257;ya</i>) the palace. The King having
come to the palace and entered it, said, &ldquo;Why did you not speak
for so much time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Queen says, &ldquo;After our mother was summoned and came
to our father, after I and a younger brother were born our mother died.
Then they brought a step-mother. Because that mother
disregards<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12088src" href="#xd27e12088"
name="xd27e12088src">4</a> younger brother and me, younger brother and
I left the country, and having entered a forest jungle, when we were
coming the flowers of a K&#299;na tree had blossomed and fallen. Taking
the faded flowers I smelt them. Thereupon younger brother said,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t smell the faded flowers; I will pluck and give [you]
flowers.&rsquo; Having said [this] and gone up the tree, at the time
when [after] plucking the flowers he was descending, younger brother
disappeared. Owing to grief at that I remained unable to
speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the King, taking axe and saw and calling people, having
gone near the K&#299;na tree, and cut and sawn <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name="pb379">379</a>]</span>the
tree, when he looked [inside it] the younger brother who was lost was
[there]. Then the King, calling the younger brother, came to the city,
and showed him to the elder sister. The elder sister arrived at
happiness again.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The story provides no explanation of the cause of the
brother&rsquo;s imprisonment inside the trunk of the tree. Apparently
the deity&mdash;presumably a Yak&#257;&mdash;who resided in the tree
punished him in this manner for plucking the flowers, yet the King cut
down the tree with impunity. At the present day, the Sinhalese
villagers would not venture to injure or pluck flowers from a tree
infested by a Yak&#257;. Many years ago all refused to fell a
Kum&#774;buk tree of this kind which it was necessary to remove from an
embankment I was restoring; but some of my Tamil coolies had not the
same scruples when encouraged by extra pay, to counterbalance the risk.
Probably they would have been less venturesome in their own
country.</p>
<p>The notion that a person may exist inside a tree trunk in a state of
suspended animation is found in other folk-tales. In No. 47, vol. i, a
N&#257;ga Princess became a tree; in an Indian variant on p. 269, the
tree was a girl imprisoned thus by R&#257;kshasas. (See the <a href=

<p class="first">At a city there exists a Beggar, begging, and
continuing to eat [thus]. There is a travellers&rsquo; shed near the
pool at which the Queen of that city bathes. The Beggar having come
[after] begging and begging, eats at that travellers&rsquo; shed.</p>
<p>When the Queen was coming [after] bathing in the water, the Beggar
went in front of her. Having said, &ldquo;Why did a Beggar like thee
come, and come in contact with me?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>He having felt (<i>lit.</i>, thought) much shame, went to the house
of the washerman who cleans the cloths of the city. He remained doing
work for him for wages. The washerman asked, &ldquo;Why are you working
for wages?&rdquo;</p>

[he said].</p>
<p>At the time when [the King] was coming to the chamber in which is
the Queen, he stopped, investigating [matters]. Before the King came,
[the Beggar], putting on the royal ornaments [and clothes], went. The
guards finished the auspicious wish;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>After that the King came. The guards thought, &ldquo;To-day the King
went here; what came he again for?&rdquo; After he went to the chamber
the Queen did not give him the auspicious wish. The King inquired why
she did that.</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;Now, on one occasion (<i lang=

become good?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a woman and a man, it
is said. The woman has also a paramour. One day the man went to a rice
field to plough. At that time, this woman having quickly cooked
milk-rice, made it ready to give to her paramour to eat.</p>
<p>While that man (her husband) was ploughing, the yoke broke; after
that, the man came home. Having seen that the man was coming, she
quickly put the pot of milk-rice under the bed in the <i lang=
"si-latn">ma&#7693;uwa</i> (open shed). That man as soon as he came sat
upon the bed; then the man was burnt [by the hot rice under him].
Thereupon the man looked under the bed. When he was looking he saw the
pot of milk-rice. Afterwards, having taken the milk-rice the man ate
it.</p>
<p>At that time, when the Queen of the King of the country was smelling
a flower, a little young frog that was in the flower had gone into her
nose, seven days before. Up to that very time, six men came, saying
that they can take out the frog; they came at the rate of a man a day.
Having come there, when he is unable to take it out they cut the
man&rsquo;s neck. At that rate they beheaded the six men who came.</p>
<p>That day the King caused the proclamation tom-toms to be
beaten:&mdash;&ldquo;To the person who should take out the young frog
that is in the Queen&rsquo;s nose, I will give a district from the
kingdom, and goods [amounting] to a tusk elephant&rsquo;s
load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this woman having heard it, went running, and said, &ldquo;My
husband can,&rdquo; and stopped the proclamation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=
"pb383">383</a>]</span>tom-toms.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12287src"
href="#xd27e12287" name="xd27e12287src">1</a> She stopped them because
the man of the house ate the milk-rice without her succeeding in giving
it to the paramour, with the motive that having killed this man she
should take the paramour to live [there].</p>
<p>Having stopped the proclamation tom-toms, and come near her husband,
she said, &ldquo;I stopped the proclamation tom-toms now. You go, and
having taken out that young frog which is in the Queen&rsquo;s nose,
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this man through fear of death lamented, and said, &ldquo;Now
six men have been beheaded, men who thoroughly know medical treatment.
I not knowing anything of this, when I have gone there they will seize
me at once and behead me. What is this you did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, through anger about the milk-rice she said, &ldquo;There
is no staying talking and talking in that way. Go quickly.&rdquo; As
she was saying the words, the messenger whom the King sent arrived
there to take the man to the palace.</p>
<p>Well then, having [thus] quickly driven away the man, the woman
speedily cooked milk-rice again, and having sent to the paramour to
come, and given him to eat, made the man stop at that very house.</p>
<p>Then the woman says to the paramour, &ldquo;Thus, in that manner the
gallows-bird<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12304src" href="#xd27e12304"
name="xd27e12304src">2</a> of our house by this time will be killed.
Now then, you remain [here] without fear.&rdquo; The paramour having
said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; stayed there.</p>
<p>Well then, when the messenger brought that man to the palace, he
said to the King: &ldquo;Maharaja, Your Majesty, this man can take out
the frog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was there, having become ready for death, the King, having
been sitting at the place where the Queen is, says to this man,
&ldquo;H&#257;, it is good. Now then, don&rsquo;t stop [there] looking.
If thou canst, apply medical treatment for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span>this
and take thou out the young frog. If thou canst not, be ready for
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon that man, having become more afraid also than he was,
began to relate the things that happened to the man:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">At a certain city there were a sister and two
brothers. These three one day went to eat Dam&#774;ba [fruits]. Having
gone thus, the two brothers went up the Dam&#774;ba tree,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12485src" href="#xd27e12485" name=
"xd27e12485src">1</a> the sister remained on the ground.</p>
<p>At that time a Bear having come, went off, taking the woman. Having
thus gone, placing her in a rock cave he provided subsistence for her.
Thereupon the two brothers, being unable to find her, went home.</p>
<p>During the time while the Princess was in the rock cave she was
rearing a cock. On yet [another] day the two Princes in order to make
search for the Princess went into the midst of the forest. Then having
heard the crowing of the cock which the Princess was rearing, they went
to that place. At that time the Bear was not there; on account of food
it went into the midst of the forest.</p>
<p>Then [the brothers] having met with the sister, they spoke to her.
The Princess said, &ldquo;The time when the Bear comes is near. Because
of that return to the village, and come to-morrow morning to go with
me.&rdquo; So both of them went to the village.</p>
<p>After that, the Bear having come, at the words which he had heard
walked away growling and growling with anger. Thereafter the two
brothers came, and returned with the Princess to the village. Two
children had been born to the Bear; with those two also they went.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bear having come to the rock cave, and perceived when
he looked that the Princess and children were not [there], came [after
them] of his own accord. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href=
"#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span>When he came, he saw by the light
the Queen and two children. Those two sprang off and went away.</p>
<p>The Bear asked the Queen, &ldquo;What are you going for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cleverer Bear than you told me to come. Because of that I
am going,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The Bear having said, &ldquo;Where is there a cleverer Bear than I?
Show me him,&rdquo; went [with her].</p>
<p>Then the Queen, having gone near a well, showed the reflection of
the Bear that was at the bottom of the water. At that time the Bear
which was on the ground sprang into the well in order to bite the Bear
that was in the well. Having sprung in he died.</p>
<p>Then the two brothers, and the Princess, and the two children went
home and stayed there.</p>

and informed him that another lion was concealed in a well, and waiting
for an opportunity to kill him. When the lion demanded to be shown him,
the jackal led him to the well; showed him his own reflection, and the
lion sprang at it. The jackal then summoned the other animals, which
rolled large stones into the well and killed the lion.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Hit&#333;pad&#275;&#347;a</i> there is a
similar story, the two animals being a lion and a stag which said
another lion had delayed it.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Fables</i> (R&#257;masw&#257;mi Raju), p. 82, the
animals were a tiger and hare.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-lore of the Telugus</i> (G. R. Subramiah Pantulu), p. 15,
they were a lion and fox (jackal) which stated that another lion had
carried off a fox that it was bringing as the lion&rsquo;s food.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i> (Swynnerton), p. 4,
they were a tiger and a hare which laid the blame on another tiger for
his being late, saying it claimed the country.</p>
<p>In <i>Old Deccan Days</i> (M. Frere), p. 172, they were a lion and a
jackal and his wife who stated that they had been delayed by another
lion.</p>
<p>In <i>The Enchanted Parrot</i> (Rev. B. H. Wortham) this story is
No. XXXI. The animals were a lion and a hare which said he had been
kept a prisoner by a rival lion. This is the form of the tale in the
<i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney), vol. ii,
p. 32. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span></p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales from Tibet</i> (O&rsquo;Connor), p. 51, they were
also a lion and a hare which recommended the lion to eat a large and
fierce animal that lived in a pond, in place of itself.</p>
<p>In <i>Fables and Folk-Tales from an Eastern Forest</i> (W. Skeat),
p. 28, they were a tiger and a mouse-deer which said it had been
stopped by an old tiger with a flying-squirrel sitting on its muzzle,
and so had been unable to bring it an animal for food. The squirrel
which accompanied the mouse-deer sat on the tiger&rsquo;s muzzle and
the deer on its hind-quarters when it went to drive the other away. The
tiger then sprang at its reflection in the river, and was drowned.

<h2 class="main">The Leopard and the Princess</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are seven Princes, it is
said. Younger than all seven there is their younger sister. For the
seven Princes seven Princesses have been brought; a Prince having been
brought for the younger sister, is settled there.</p>
<p>While they are thus, the younger sister has pregnancy longings
(<i lang="si-latn">doladuk</i>). One day, while the younger sister and
her elder brothers were going to their houses, having seen the whole
seven Princesses eating Dam&#774;ba [fruits] the younger sister also
stayed there to eat them, and asked at the hand of the eldest
sister-in-law, &ldquo;Sister-in-law, a Dam&#774;ba fruit for me
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the sister-in-law said, &ldquo;There will not be Dam&#774;ba
here to give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She asked at the hand of the next sister-in-law. That sister-in-law
also replied in the same way. Thus, in that manner having asked at the
hand of the whole seven, not even one person gave it.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the younger sister having cooked and eaten, went alone
to pluck Dam&#774;ba, and having ascended the Dam&#774;ba tree, while
she was eating Dam&#774;ba it became night.</p>
<p>A Leopard having come near the Dam&#774;ba tree [said], &ldquo;[How]
if you should throw down a Dam&#774;ba branch with your golden little
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Princess threw down a Dam&#774;ba branch. The
Leopard having eaten [the fruit on] it, said again, &ldquo;[How] if you
should throw down a Dam&#774;ba branch with your golden little
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she threw one down. Then the Leopard said, &ldquo;Holding
fast, fast, [how] if you should slowly slowly descend?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name=
"pb389">389</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then through fear the Princess is there without descending.</p>
<p>The Leopard another time said, &ldquo;Holding fast, fast, [how] if
you should slowly slowly descend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess descended. Then the Leopard, placing the Princess on
his back, went to his rock cave. While living in that manner the
Princess bore a child. The Leopard and Princess stayed there very
trustfully. The Leopard had much goods. The paddy store-rooms had been
filled, the millet store-rooms had been filled, the men&#275;ri
store-rooms had been filled, there are many cattle.</p>
<p>When they had been living there many days, the Leopard said,
&ldquo;I am about to go on a journey to-morrow; I shall be unable to
return for two or three days. You, shutting the rock cave, must be
[here]. Until the time when I come do not go outside.&rdquo; On the
following day the Leopard went away.</p>
<p>Well then, while the Princess was alone in the rock cave, the elder
brothers of the Princess having come hunting, a great rain rained. The
Princes having been [sheltering] near a tree, when they were walking
along in the rain they met with the rock cave, and saw also their
younger sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What art thou here for? We sought and sought so much time,
and could not find thee. Here thou art! What was the manner in which
thou camest here?&rdquo; they asked at the hand of their younger
sister.</p>
<p>Then the younger sister said, &ldquo;I asked for Dam&#774;ba at the
hand of sisters-in-law. The whole seven did not give it. On account of
that I came to eat Dam&#774;ba, and while I was alone in the
Dam&#774;ba tree the Leopard came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards he told me to throw down a Dam&#774;ba branch; I
threw down two Dam&#774;ba branches. Saying and saying [it was only]
until the time when the Leopard was going, I stayed in the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I was there it became night. Then the Leopard told me
to descend. I stayed [there] without descending. The Leopard told me
twice to descend. Afterwards I descended. The Leopard, putting me on
his back, came here. From that day I am living here.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name=
"pb390">390</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Princes asked, &ldquo;Where is the Leopard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;This morning he went somewhere or other;
he said he will not come for a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Princes said, &ldquo;No matter for that one; let us
go away home. We will take the things that are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo; What of her saying,
&ldquo;I will not!&rdquo; The Princes, having taken all the [household]
things that were there, said to the Princess, &ldquo;Let us
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Princess through anger cut that child, and hung it
aloft, near the hearth. She placed the small pot on the hearth, and
taking a [piece of] muslin, all along the path tore and tore and threw
down pieces, until the time when they went to the house. Having gone
there, without eating she is crying and crying.</p>
<p>Then the Leopard came near the rock cave, and saw that the child
having been cut had been hung up; and having seen, also, that the
Princess was not there, came away.</p>
<p>Having come all along the path on which the muslin has been torn and
thrown down, and having come up to the house [in a human form]; he saw
that the Princess is there. While the Leopard is in the open space in
front of the house, the Princess saw that the Leopard is [there]; and
having come laughing, and given water to the Leopard to wash his face,
and given sitting accommodation, and betel to eat, she is cooking in
order to give the Leopard to eat.</p>
<p>Then the Princes placed an earthen pot of water on the hearth, to
become heated. After it became heated, they cut a hole very deeply, and
put sticks on it, and above that leaves, and above that earth; and
having taken the pot of water and placed it there, they came near the
Leopard, and said to the Leopard, &ldquo;Let us go, brother-in-law, to
bathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Leopard said, &ldquo;I cannot bathe, brother-in-law. As I was
coming I bathed; I cannot bathe another time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Leopard was saying he could not, having gone calling the
Leopard they told him to place his feet at the place where those sticks
and leaves and earth have been put; and having told him to bend, they
poured that pot of boiling water on the Leopard&rsquo;s body. That one
having fallen into the hole that was cut deep, died. Those seven
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>Princes having thrown in earth and filled it up,
came away and ate cooked rice.</p>
<p>That younger sister, having cooked and finished, seeks the Leopard.
While she is seeking him the sisters-in-law say, &ldquo;Sister-in-law,
you eat that cooked rice. Elder brother is eating cooked rice
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess is [there] without eating. While she is there the
sisters-in-law say again, &ldquo;Sister-in-law, eat; elder brother is
eating cooked rice here. He will not come there, having become angry
that you have come [away].&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Princess came to look [for him]. Having looked at
the whole seven houses without finding the Leopard, she went to the
place where he bathed, and when she looked [saw that] earth was [newly]
cut and placed there.</p>
<p>Having seen it, thinking, &ldquo;Here indeed having murdered him,
this earth has been cut and placed [over him],&rdquo; she went into the
house, and did not eat; and having been weeping and weeping, and been
two or three days without food, the Princess died through very grief at
the loss of the Leopard.</p>
<p>The eight Princes and the seven Princesses, taking the
Leopard&rsquo;s goods and the Princess&rsquo;s goods, remained
there.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In <i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. xiv, p. 135 ff.
(<i>Folklore in Southern India</i>, p. 116), in a Tamil story by
Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;, a girl who had married and
gone off with a tiger disguised in the form of a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a
youth, escaped when her three brothers, in response to her request sent
by a crow, came to rescue her. She first tore in two the tiger cub she
had borne, and hung the pieces to roast over the fire. The tiger
followed in the form of a youth, was well received, and food was
cooked. On the pretext of giving him the customary oil bath (of
Southern India) before dining, the brothers put sticks across the well,
and laid mats over them. When the tiger-youth sat there for the bath he
fell into the well, which they filled with stones, etc. The girl raised
a pillar (apparently of mud) over the well, with a tulas&#299; (basil)
plant at the top; and during the rest of her life she smeared the
pillar in the morning and evening with cow-dung, and watered the
plant.</p>
<p>In the Kolh&#257;n folk-tales (Bompas), appended to <i>Folklore of
the Santal Parganas</i>, p. 454, a tiger which assisted a Raja by
carrying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name=
"pb392">392</a>]</span>a load of grass for him, received in marriage
one of the Raja&rsquo;s daughters as a recompense. He ate her, and when
he went to ask for another in her place, saying she had died, boiling
water was poured over him while he was asleep, and he was killed. At p.
470, a Raja married a she-bear which took the place of his bride in her
palankin; apparently the bear had a human form.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i> (Knowles), 2nd ed., p. 57, the
concealed pit-fall into which people fell is found. It was dug in one
of the rooms of a merchant&rsquo;s house. A King, his son, and his wife
the Queen were entrapped; but the King&rsquo;s daughter-in-law
suspected some trick, refused to enter the house, and rescued them.</p>
<p>There is a variant in the coast districts on the north bank of the
River Congo, in West Africa. In <i>Notes on the Folklore of the
Fjort</i> (Dennett), p. 49, a girl who had run away from home on
account of her sisters&rsquo; bad treatment of her, was married to a
man who was a murderer. She wanted to return to her mother, made a
flying basket, and escaped in it, carrying off his ornaments and
slaves. Her husband saw the basket going through the air, and followed
it. The girl&rsquo;s relations received him well, dug a deep hole and
covered it with sticks and a mat, and prepared a great quantity of
boiling water. Then they called the girl and her husband to sit there,
placing the man over the hole. He fell into it, the water and burning
wood were thrown over him, and he died.</p>
<p>This Sinhalese story contains the only instance I have met with in
Ceylon of a belief in power of the lower animals to take the form of
men, with the exception of tales in which they have a removable skin or
shell which hides a human form. In China the fox is thought to have the
power of taking a human shape at will, and in <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents
Contes et Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol. i, p. 76, one of these
animals became a man in order to obtain a bag of roasted grain to
present to an aged Br&#257;hma&#7751;a. In <i>Folklore of the Santal
Parganas</i> (collected by Rev. Dr. Bodding), p. 442, a man who had
learnt witchcraft turned himself into a tiger in order to eat a calf.
He gave his wife a piece of root first, and told her that when she
applied it to his nose he would become a man again. Such changes as
that occur in the Indian story numbered 266 in vol. iii, and its
Sinhalese variants, in which the animals can then resume their human
form.</p>
<p>It is a common belief in Africa that some animals have this power
(having the souls of men in them), and also that human beings can
transform themselves into the lower animals, usually dangerous ones. In
<i>Reynard the Fox in Southern Africa</i> (Dr. Bleek), p. 57, in a
Hottentot story a woman became a lion at her husband&rsquo;s request,
in order to catch a zebra for their food. In <i>The Fetish Folk of West
Africa</i> (Milligan), p. 226, it is stated that &ldquo;there is a man
in the Gaboon of whom the whole community believes that he frequently
changes himself into a leopard in order to steal sheep and to devour a
whole sheep at a meal.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country, at the season when a
Gamar&#257;la and his son are causing cattle to graze, having
constructed a fold in a good manner the Gamar&#257;la encloses the
cattle in the fold.</p>
<p>One day, the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s son having driven in the cattle,
while he was blocking up the gap (entrance) of the fold the
Gamar&#257;la said, it is said, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Close the gap
well; leopards and other animals (<i lang=
"si-latn">ko&#7789;iy&#333;-bo&#7789;iy&#333;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12708src" href="#xd27e12708" name="xd27e12708src">1</a>) will
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was there, a big Leopard which was near having heard this
speech that he is making, thinks, &ldquo;The Leopard indeed is I; what
is the Bo&#7789;iy&#257;?&rdquo; In fear, with various ideas [about
it], he got inside the fold; but having thought that the
Bo&#7789;iy&#257; will come now, he went into the midst of the calves,
and in the middle of them, his happiness being ended, he remained.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a thief having got inside the fold, came lifting
and lifting up the calves [to ascertain which was the heaviest]. Having
come near the Leopard, when he lifted it up he placed the Leopard on
his shoulder [in order to carry it away], because it was very heavy.
The Leopard thinks, &ldquo;This one, indeed, is the
Bo&#7789;iy&#257;.&rdquo; Having thought, &ldquo;Should I [try to]
escape he will kill me,&rdquo; it was motionless. And the thief because
he went quickly in the night [with it], for that reason thought that
the calf was very good. At the time when he turned and looked at it he
perceived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name=
"pb394">394</a>]</span>that it was a Leopard, and he considered in what
manner he could escape.</p>
<p>Having seen a hill near there, near an abandoned pansala (the
residence of a Buddhist monk), the man threw it down from the hill, and
got inside the pansala. When he shut the door, anger having come to the
Leopard by reason of the harm done to him [owing to his fall], at the
time when he was near the door [trying to enter in order to kill the
man], a Jackal asked the Leopard, &ldquo;Why is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he told the Jackal the reason, the Jackal thought he would like
to eat the Leopard&rsquo;s flesh, [and therefore said], &ldquo;I will
tell you, Sir, a stratagem for opening the door. Should you put that
tail of yours, Sir, through that hole the door will open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time when he said [this], the Leopard having thought that by
this skilful act the door will open, put his tail through. Thereupon
the thief twisted the tail round the post that was near the door.</p>
<p>At the time when he was holding it, the Jackal went to the rice
field near there in which men were working. While the Jackal was crying
and crying out to the men, &ldquo;Please come near, please come
near,&rdquo; they went near the pansala. Having seen the Leopard, and
beaten and killed the Leopard, they took away the skin, it is said.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal with much delight ate the Leopard&rsquo;s flesh, it
is said.</p>

<p class="first">This story is a variant of No. 70 in vol. i.</p>
<p>In <i>The Orientalist</i>, vol. iv, p. 30, Mr. W. Goonetilleke gave
a nearly similar story. The fold was one in which goats and sheep were
enclosed. The man carried off the leopard which was concealed among
them, and on discovering his mistake threw it down into a stream as he
was crossing an &#275;da&#7751;&#7693;a, or foot-bridge made of a tree
trunk. He then ran off and got hid in a corn-store, where the jackal
told him to twist the tail round a post, as related in vol. i, p.
368.</p>
<p>In <i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. xiv, p. 77 (<i>Tales of the
Sun</i>, p. 93), in a Tamil story given by Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a
S&#257;str&#299;, a shepherd, when he left his flock temporarily, fixed
his stick at the place with his rug over it, and told it to keep watch,
or some thief or <i lang="si-latn">bh&#363;ta</i> or <i lang=

bh&#363;ta, or evil spirit, which had come for this purpose, overheard
this, and being afraid of the unknown animal called a k&#363;ta, lay
down amid the flock. Two men who came to steal a goat selected the
bh&#363;ta, and carried it off as being the fattest. Thinking these
were the k&#363;tas, the bh&#363;ta tried to escape, and eventually
melted away. The later incidents do not resemble those of this

<p class="first">In a certain country there were a man&rsquo;s eight
asses. One of them having been lost one day, while he was going seeking
and looking for it [he saw] in the night that there was a house near a
great jungle. In the house he heard a talk. After that he halted, and
when he is listening to ascertain what is this talk which he hears, a
woman says, &ldquo;An&#275;! O Gods, during this night I indeed am not
afraid of either an elephant, or a bear, or a leopard, or a Yak&#257;;
I am only afraid of the &#7692;abukk&#257;,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The Leopard listening very near there said [to himself], &ldquo;What
is the &#7692;abukk&#257; of which she is afraid, which is greater than
the elephant, and the bear, and the leopard, and the Yak&#257;?&rdquo;
Having become afraid in his mind he stood on one side, and remained
looking [out for it].</p>
<p>Then the man who being without that ass sought for it, saw the
Leopard [in the semi-darkness], and having said, &ldquo;Is it the
ass?&rdquo; went running and mounted on the back of the Leopard.
Saying, &ldquo;O ass of the strumpet&rsquo;s son, why were you hidden
last night?&rdquo; he began to beat the Leopard. Having thought
&ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! It is this indeed they call the
&#7692;abukk&#257;,&rdquo; through fear it began to run away.</p>
<p>As it was becoming light, that man, perceiving that it was the
Leopard, jumped off its back, and having gone running crept inside a
hollow in a tree.</p>
<p>The Leopard having gone running on and fallen, a Jackal, seeing that
it was panting, asked, &ldquo;Friend, what are you staying there for as
though you have been frightened?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb397" href="#pb397" name="pb397">397</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend, during the whole of yester-night the
&#7692;abukk&#257;, having mounted on my back, drove me about, beating
and beating me enough to kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Jackal says, &ldquo;Though you were afraid of it I indeed
am not afraid. Show me it. Let us go for me to eat up that one,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>The Leopard says, &ldquo;I will not go first,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Jackal said, &ldquo;Pull out a creeper, and tying it at your
waist tie [the other end] on my neck,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>When they had tied the creeper, after the Jackal went in front near
the tree in which that man stayed, the Leopard said, &ldquo;There. It
is in the hollow in that tree, indeed,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Jackal snarled. Then when the man struck the Jackal in the midst
of the mouth his teeth were broken. After that, [both of them], the
Jackal howling and howling, having run off and gone away, when they
were out of breath a Bear came and asked &ldquo;Friends, what are you
panting for to that extent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Leopard says, &ldquo;Yester-night the &#7692;abukk&#257; killed
me. The Jackal having gone to eat it, when he howled and snarled it
broke two [of his] teeth,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the Bear said, &ldquo;What of your being unable [to kill it]!
Let us go, for me to eat up that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole three went, the Bear being in front and close to it the
Jackal; the Leopard went behind them. Having gone, they showed the Bear
the place where the man was. The Bear having put its head inside the
hollow in the tree, roared. Then the man seized the hair of its head
fast with his hand. When it was drawing its head back the hair came
out. Then the whole three, speaking and speaking, ran away, with their
teeth chattering and their tails between their legs.</p>
<p>Afterwards the man having descended from the tree to the ground,
came to his village with a party of men.</p>

<p class="first">In <i>Indian Fairy Tales</i> (Thornhill), p. 227, a
tiger heard an old woman say, &ldquo;I do not fear the tiger; what I
fear is the dripping; when the rain falls the dripping comes through
the thatch and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name=
"pb398">398</a>]</span>troubles me.&rdquo; The tiger lay still,
dreading the coming of the terrible Dripping. A washerman whose ass had
strayed came there, and thinking he had found it struck it with his
stick and drove it to the village pound, where he fastened it by the
leg, the tiger believing he must be the Dripping. In the morning it
begged for mercy, and was allowed to go on promising to leave the
district and not eat men.</p>
<p>In <i>Old Deccan Days</i> (M. Frere), p. 206, the same story is
repeated, the ass being one belonging to a potter who seized the tiger,
beat and kicked it, rode it home, tied it to a post, and went to bed.
Next day everyone came to see it, and the R&#257;ja gave the man great
rewards, and made him a General.</p>
<p>In <i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i> (Swynnerton), p. 211,
when a weaver who had been ordered to kill a tiger was entering his
house he saw it outside. Saying loudly that he was going to kill the
tiger, he added that he did not care for the wet or the tiger, but only
for the dripping of the rain from the roof. The tiger was afraid, and
slunk into an outhouse, the door of which the weaver immediately shut
and locked. Next morning he reported that he had captured it with his
hands, without the use of weapons.</p>
<p>In a Malinka story of Senegambia in <i lang="fr">Contes
Soudanais</i> (C. Monteil), p. 137, a hare, while its partner, a
hy&aelig;na, collected firewood, hid the flesh of a cow that they had
killed, in a hollow baobab tree, the entrance being too small to admit
the hy&aelig;na. The latter returned with an ostrich and saw the hare
there. The ostrich came forward to seize it, but when its head was
inside the hare slipped a noose over it and half-choked it. In its
struggles the ostrich laid an egg, which the hy&aelig;na immediately
devoured. The hare then induced it to believe that when they were half
choked in the same way hy&aelig;nas laid much better eggs. The
hy&aelig;na accordingly inserted its head, and was noosed and
strangled. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=

looking out seized a small Calf out of them, and at first ate an
ear.</p>

share of the meat. The hare&rsquo;s suggestion that to avoid the loss
of the blood the ass should be strangled was adopted, the fox borrowed
a rope from a shepherd, the hare put slip-knots over the necks of each

for all to pull. When they did so the wolf and fox were strangled, and

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain time at a certain village there were a
husband and a wife. During the time when they were [there] the two
together went to a chena. Having gone, [after] plucking an Ash-pumpkin
they brought it and placed it in a large pot under seven earthen
cooking pots.</p>
<p>When not much time had gone, the seven earthen cooking pots were
shaken. Then this party having opened the mouths of the cooking pots,
when they looked a Python had filled up the large pot.</p>
<p>After that, the party plaited seven beds.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12934src" href="#xd27e12934" name="xd27e12934src">1</a> Having
plaited them, they caused the Python to sleep on the seven beds.</p>
<p>Next, having gone to a place where seven daughters were, they asked
for an assistant (a wife) for that Python. Having asked, they brought
the eldest sister. Having brought her, when they opened the house door
the woman having seen this Python and being afraid, said,
&ldquo;An&#275;! The way in which fathers have sought and given me in
marriage!&rdquo; and just as it became light the girl went home.</p>
<p>In that manner they brought the six women. All six being afraid of
this Python went away.</p>
<p>They brought the youngest girl of the seven. [She] having come
there, when two or three months had gone they opened the house door.
After that, the girl having seen the Python and being afraid, said in
distress, &ldquo;An&#275;! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href=
"#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span>The danger that my parents have
made for me, having given me in <i lang="si-latn">d&#299;ga</i>
[marriage] to a Python! There is no place for me to lie
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Python having made room on one out of the seven beds,
remained on six.</p>
<p>On the following day she spoke in the same manner. Then the Python,
having made room on two out of the seven beds, remained on five. On the
following day in the evening she spoke in the same manner; then the
Python, having made room on three out of the seven beds, was on four.
On the following day in the evening she spoke in the same manner; then
the Python, having made room on four out of the seven beds, was on
three. On the following day evening she said the same; then the Python,
having made room on five out of the seven beds, was on two. On the
following day evening she said the same; then the Python, having made
room on six out of the seven beds, was on one.</p>
<p>On the seventh day morning the Python came to the veranda. At that
time, the mother-in-law of the woman who had come in d&#299;ga
[marriage] to the Python, said to the woman, &ldquo;Daughter, lower a
little paddy from the corn store,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12954src"
href="#xd27e12954" name="xd27e12954src">2</a> and having winnowed, boil
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman (girl), for the sake of causing the Python to speak,
applied (<i lang="si-latn">dunn&#257;</i>, presented) the forked pole
[for raising the conical roof] on the outer side of the eaves.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12963src" href="#xd27e12963" name=
"xd27e12963src">3</a></p>
<p>Then the Python says, &ldquo;In our country our mother said that on
the other side (<i>lit.</i>, hand) is the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the woman, having applied the forked pole on the inner
side, and raised the (conical) roof, and lowered paddy, put it on the
outer side of the winnowing tray, and began to winnow it.</p>
<p>Then the Python says, &ldquo;It is not in that way. In our country
our mother said on the other side is the way.&rdquo; So the woman put
it on the inner side of the winnowing tray, and winnowed the paddy.</p>
<p>Having winnowed it, still for the sake of causing the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403</a>]</span>Python to speak she put the paddy on the outer
side of the large cooking pot, and prepared (<i>lit.</i>, made) to boil
it.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Python says, &ldquo;It is not in that way. In our
country our mother said on the other side is the way.&rdquo; So the
woman, having put it inside the large cooking pot, boiled the
paddy.</p>
<p>Still for the sake of causing the Python to speak having [taken out
the paddy, and] placed it on the outer side of the mat, she prepared to
spread out the paddy to dry.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Python says, &ldquo;It is not in that way. In our
country our mother said on the other side is the way.&rdquo; So the
woman, having put it on the inner side of the mat, spread out the paddy
to dry.</p>
<p>The woman, also for the sake of causing the Python to speak, having
[taken it up after it was dried, and] placed it on the outer side (end)
of the paddy mortar, prepared to pound the paddy.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Python says, &ldquo;It is not in that way. In our
country our mother said at the other side (end) is the way.&rdquo; So
having put it on the inside, and pounded the paddy [to remove the
skin], she winnowed it. (It was now cleaned rice, ready for
cooking.)</p>
<p>Then a Bana (reading of the Buddhist Scriptures) having been
appointed at the pansala near that village, all are going to the Bana.
This woman says, &ldquo;Owing to the fate which my parents have made
for me there is also no hearing Bana [for me].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Python says, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you bracelets and
rings to put on as ornaments? Haven&rsquo;t you dresses? Wearing them
and adorning [yourself] in a good manner, go with our parents,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>Then the woman says, &ldquo;Other good caste (<i lang=
"si-latn">ra&#7789;&#275;</i>) women go, sending the men
first.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13004src" href="#xd27e13004" name=
"xd27e13004src">4</a> It does not matter that I must go
alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, still the Python says, &ldquo;I am staying at
home<span class="corr" id="xd27e13009" title="Not in source">.</span>
Go with my parents,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then while the woman was going with her mother-in-law&rsquo;s party
to hear Bana, the Python, having got hid, remained <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span>at
the road on which she intended to go. At that time the Python having
taken off his Python jacket and having placed it on the clothes-line in
the enclosure (<i lang="si-latn">malu &#257;n&#275;</i>), went to hear
the Bana [in the form of a Prince].</p>
<p>Thereupon, this woman having seen her husband who was going to the
pansala, came home, and having taken the Python jacket which was placed
on the clothes-line in the enclosure and put it [in the fire] on the
hearth, the woman, too, went back to hear the Bana. Thereafter, the
Python Prince having returned, when he looked for the Python jacket it
had been put on the hearth [and burnt]. Thereupon he remained as a
husband for that woman.</p>
<p>After that, when not much time had gone, telling her, and having
prepared, they went to the house of his mother-in-law and
father-in-law. Thereupon the six women who were brought at first for
the Python, having said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Our husband is coming,&rdquo;
came in front [of him].</p>
<p>Then this younger woman, having said, &ldquo;At first having said ye
do not want him, how does the Prince who has come become yours now? He
belongs only to me,&rdquo; began to quarrel [with them].</p>
<p>Then of those six women the eldest woman having longed for this
Python Prince, said, &ldquo;Father, seek for a Python for me, and give
me it,&rdquo; and remained without eating and without drinking.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the man being unable to get rid [of the importunity] of
that eldest daughter, calling men and having gone, and having set nets,
when they were driving (<i lang="si-latn">elawana-ko&#7789;a</i>) the
middle of the forest a Python was caught in the net.</p>
<p>Having brought the Python, the father of the woman, having asked her
and said he brought it as her husband, put it in the house (room) of
the woman, and said, &ldquo;There. Take charge of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the woman having gone into the house, [after] shutting the
door unfastened the sack in which was the Python. Then the Python
seized the woman, and twisting around her, making fold after fold,
began to eat her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405"
name="pb405">405</a>]</span></p>
<p>At that time, the father of the woman [hearing sounds] like throwing
down coconuts in the corn store, like pouring water into the water jar,
said two or three times, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill my daughter,
A&#7693;&#275;!&rdquo; Then the Python, having completely swallowed the
woman, remained [as though] unconscious.</p>
<p>On the following day, in the morning, the woman&rsquo;s parents
having come and said, &ldquo;Daughter, open the door,&rdquo; called her
two or three times. Having called her, when they looked [for a reply]
she did not speak.</p>
<p>Because of that, having broken [through] the wall near the door
bolt, and opened the door, when they looked, the Python, having
swallowed the woman,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13044src" href=
"#xd27e13044" name="xd27e13044src">5</a> remained [as though]
unconscious. Thereupon, they drove away and sent off the Python.</p>

<p>Six out of the seven royal daughters having said, &ldquo;Are we also
female Kabaragoy&#257;s to go with Kabaragoy&#257;s?&rdquo; scolded and
struck her; the young royal Princess who was the last, said,
&ldquo;Mother, I will go.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408"
href="#pb408" name="pb408">408</a>]</span></p>
<p>At that time having come summoning the royal Princess, she married
and gave her to the Kabaragoy&#257;.</p>
<p>After a little time went thus, for the purpose of the occasion of a
certain feast the King<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13111src" href=
"#xd27e13111" name="xd27e13111src">2</a> sent a letter to the
Kabaragoy&#257; and his royal daughter, [inviting them to it].
Thereupon the royal Princess having said, &ldquo;An&#275;! How shall I
go with this Kabaragoy&#257;, without shame?&rdquo; While she is
grieving, the Kabaragoy&#257; went to a certain rock cave, and having
taken off and put there the Kabaragoy&#257; jacket, and decorated
himself [in the form of a Prince], with royal ornaments, returned. At
that time the royal daughter also, much pleased, went to the royal
palace.</p>
<p>After that, this Prince, wearing royal ornaments, remained in the
appearance of a Prince.</p>

<p class="first">In a certain country, at a house there was a very
wealthy nobleman (<i lang="si-latn">si&#7789;&#257;na</i>), but he had
no children. Having seen that the men of the country are giving their
children in <i lang="si-latn">d&#299;ga</i> [marriage] he was much
grieved.</p>
<p>While he is thus, one day at the time when he went to the rice
field, having said, &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; a certain female Frog fell
weeping at the edge of his foot; and the nobleman having brought this
female Frog home, nourished it.</p>
<p>One day, having started on a journey, and tied up a bundle of cooked
rice, and in the midst of it having put several rings, at the time when
he was going along the path taking the bundle of cooked rice it became
night while [he was] near a house, and he went there for the
resting-place.</p>
<p>At that house there was a young man. In the evening having
unfastened the bundle of cooked rice, at the time when he was eating
the rice he met with the rings, and having said, &ldquo;An&#275;! My
daughter&rsquo;s rings have fallen into the bundle of cooked
rice,&rdquo; he showed them to the house people.</p>
<p>Thereupon the house persons asked, &ldquo;Is there a
daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, an only daughter of mine,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an only male child of mine, also. Will you give your
daughter to him?&rdquo; the house-wife asked.</p>
<p>The nobleman having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; [after] fixing a
day came away.</p>
<p>On the appointed day, to look at the young woman the young man and
his two parents came. At the time when they asked the nobleman,
&ldquo;Where is the daughter?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;To-day she went
with her grandfather.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href=
"#pb410" name="pb410">410</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;If so, on such and such a day we will come to
summon her to go,&rdquo; they went away.</p>
<p>On that day, at the time when the young man and his two parents came
he showed them his female Frog. After that, the young man&rsquo;s two
parents were not satisfied, but the young man being satisfied,
summoning the female Frog they went away.</p>
<p>After a little time went by, they were to go to a [wedding] festival
house. While the young man was in sorrow thinking of it, this female
Frog took off her frog jacket [and thereupon became a young woman].
After that they went to the festival house. During the time afterwards,
these two according to the usual custom dwelt excellently
[together].</p>

<h2 class="main">The Four-faced King and the Turtle</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain city there was a King with four faces.
The King thought he must take the city called Ibb&#257;wa.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e13179src" href="#xd27e13179" name=
"xd27e13179src">1</a> For ten million lakhs (a billion) of turtles who
are in that Ibb&#257;wa city, the Chief is the Turtle King.</p>
<p>To kill the Turtle King and seize the city this Four-faced King
went, taking many troops, and taking his sword. Having gone there,
after having surrounded Ibb&#257;wa city, and set guards (<i lang=
"si-latn">raekal&#257;</i>), he sent a letter to the Turtle King:
&ldquo;What is it? Wilt thou give thy city to us? If not, wilt thou
fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Turtle King says, &ldquo;For thy having thy four faces
we are not afraid. What of thy four faces! We are dwelling with iron
dishes both above and below us. Shouldst thou shoot at us and strike
us, no harm will <span class="corr" id="xd27e13191" title=
"Source: befal">befall</span> us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Four-faced King, having said, &ldquo;H&#257;! If so,
let us fight,&rdquo; began to fight.</p>
<p>The Turtle King says to the other turtles, &ldquo;Do ye decorate
yourselves to go to battle.&rdquo; He gave notice to the whole of the
turtles.</p>
<p>The Four-faced King having ascertained that the turtles were being
decorated for the battle, the King became afraid, and thought of going
back. Because the King at first had not seen the turtles, although the
Turtle King was about a y&#333;jana (perhaps sixteen miles) high and
broad, and since it was the royal city, he says, &ldquo;We did not come
for the war, O Turtle King. I came to ask to marry Your Majesty&rsquo;s
daughter to my son, Prince Kimbiya.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name="pb412">412</a>]</span></p>
<p>After that, the Turtle King thinks, &ldquo;At no time were men able
to be tied [in marriage] to us. Because of it, we must give our
daughter Gal-ibb&#299; (Tortoise).&rdquo; Having said [this] he was
satisfied. So the Four-faced King and the King&rsquo;s army entered
Ibb&#257;wa city.</p>
<p>Well then, the Turtle King having given quarters to the army and the
Four-faced King, made ready food. Because before that the turtles were
not accustomed to give food and drink to men, having brought putrid
birds (<i lang="si-latn">kunu sakunu</i>) that turtles eat and drink,
they gave them to all.</p>
<p>After that, the Four-faced King says, &ldquo;We do not eat this
food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the turtles ask, &ldquo;If so, O Four-faced King, what do you
eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Four-faced King said, &ldquo;We eat rice and
curry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then because the Turtle King receives the thing he wished for,
having created very suitable food he gave it to the Four-faced King and
the army.</p>
<p>After that, the Turtle King and the Four-faced King having spoken
[about it], appointed the [wedding] festival for the seventh day from
to-day.</p>
<p>The Four-faced King and the army having come to [their own] city,
say, &ldquo;We will not summon a [bride in] marriage from those
turtles.&rdquo; Having said it, they remained without going to
Ibb&#257;wa city.</p>
<p>This Turtle King, after seven days passed, says to the other
turtles, &ldquo;Having said that they will take a [bride in] marriage
from us, they treated us with contempt. Because of it, let us go to
fight with the Four-faced King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, the Turtle King, having come with the ten million lakhs
of turtles, [after] setting guards round the city of the Four-faced
King, says to the Four-faced King, &ldquo;Will you fight with us, or
take the marriage that was first spoken of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Four-faced King began to fight with the Turtle King.
Having fought for seven days, the Four-faced King having been defeated,
and the city people also being killed, the Turtle King got the
sovereignty of the city. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href=
"#pb413" name="pb413">413</a>]</span>Having spared only the son of the
Four-faced King, Prince Kimbiya, to that Prince he gave Gal-Ibb&#299;,
the daughter of the Turtle King. Beginning from that time, the Turtle
King exercised the sovereignty over both cities.</p>
<p>Having summoned Gal-Ibb&#299; [in marriage] seven Princes were
begotten by Prince Kimbiya. The seven persons after they became big and
great ascertaining that they were born from the womb of the tortoise,
the mother of each of them, through shame ripping open (<i>lit.</i>,
splitting) each other, the whole seven died.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Story of the Cobra and the Prince</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a country, during the time when a Prince is causing
cattle to graze, the cattle having borne [calves] he goes to take milk
in the morning every day, it is said.</p>
<p>While he was going one day, at the time when he was bringing milk
having met with a N&#257;gay&#257; and a female Cobra,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e13248src" href="#xd27e13248" name=
"xd27e13248src">1</a> the N&#257;gay&#257; said, &ldquo;Will you bring
and give me every day, morning by morning, one leaf-cup of
milk?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13257src" href="#xd27e13257"
name="xd27e13257src">2</a> he asked. The Prince said, &ldquo;I will
bring and give it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was bringing and giving it no long time, one day when he was
taking the milk on that day the N&#257;gay&#257; was not [there]; the
female Cobra and a Rat-snake were [there]. Well then, at his hand the
female Cobra asked for the leaf-cup of milk. The Prince did not give
it; he poured the milk into an ant-hill.</p>
<p>At the time when the N&#257;gay&#257; came from the journey on which
he went, the female Cobra says, &ldquo;The Prince having come, not
giving the milk went away.&rdquo; When she said this, the
N&#257;gay&#257; having become angry went to the house at which the
Prince stays, and remained at the corner of the mat on which the Prince
sleeps.</p>
<p>While it is [there] the Prince says [aloud to himself]<span class=
"corr" id="xd27e13267" title="Source: .">,</span> &ldquo;Now for a long
time I was going and giving milk to a N&#257;gay&#257; and a female
Cobra. To-day I went, taking the milk. When I was going the
N&#257;gay&#257; was not [there]. Because the female Cobra and a
Rat-snake were on the ant-hill, the female Cobra asked me for the milk.
Not giving it I came home, having poured it into an
ant-hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The N&#257;gay&#257; having become angry regarding it, came
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name=
"pb415">415</a>]</span>back, and having bitten and killed the female
Cobra, heaped her up. On the following morning, at the time when the
Prince took the milk only the N&#257;gay&#257; was [there]; the female
Cobra was killed.</p>
<p>Further, the N&#257;gay&#257; says to the Prince, &ldquo;Lie down
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince without lying down began to run away. At the time when
the N&#257;gay&#257; was going chasing after him the Prince fell. The
Cobra having mounted on his breast, [said], &ldquo;Do you without fear
extend your tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince afterwards in fear stretched out his tongue. On his
tongue the N&#257;gay&#257; with the N&#257;gay&#257;&rsquo;s tongue
wrote letters. &ldquo;Having heard all kinds of creatures talk you will
understand them. Do not tell it to anyone,&rdquo; [he said]. Afterwards
the N&#257;gay&#257; died. He burnt up the N&#257;gay&#257;.</p>
<p>The Prince having come home, while he is [there], when the
Prince&rsquo;s wife is coming out from the house small red ants
(<i lang="si-latn">k&#363;m&#774;biy&#333;</i>) say, &ldquo;A woman
like the boards of this door, having trampled [on us] on going and
coming, kills us,&rdquo; they said. The Prince having understood it,
laughed.</p>
<p>When his wife in various ways was asking, &ldquo;Why did you
laugh?&rdquo; anger having come to him [he determined to burn himself
on a funeral pyre, so] he said, &ldquo;You in the morning having cooked
food and apportioned it to me too, eat you also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having eaten it, at the time when they are going, taking an axe, and
a [water] gourd, and fire, two pigs having been digging and digging at
a tank a pig says, &ldquo;That Prince to-day will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The [other] pig says, &ldquo;The Prince will not die. Having
constructed a funeral pyre (<i lang="si-latn">saeyak</i>), the Prince
will mount on it. Water-thirst having come, he will tell his wife to
bring water,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;She having gone, when she is
bringing the water she will slip and fall and will die,&rdquo; it
said.</p>
<p>He having constructed the funeral pyre, when the Prince mounted on
it a water-thirst came. He told his wife to bring water. She went [to
the tank for it], and having gone slipping through the amount of the
weight, she fell in the water and died. Having put his wife on the pyre
and burnt her, afterwards he went home.</p>

<p class="first">This story affords an illustration of a common belief
in Ceylon, that cobras sometimes pair with rat-snakes. The Prince is
evidently thought to have acted in a becoming manner in refusing to
give the milk to the female cobra when she was improperly associating
with the rat-snake during the absence of her mate.</p>
<p>Regarding the drinking of milk by cobras, mention is made in the
J&#257;taka story No. 146 (vol. i, p. 311) of an offering of milk,
among other things, made to N&#257;gas. Dr. Chalmers Mitchell, F.R.S.,
the Secretary to the Zoological Society, has been good enough to reply
as follows to my inquiry regarding the drinking of milk by
cobras:&mdash;&ldquo;I have not myself seen Cobras drinking milk, but I
am sure that they will do so, and I see no reason to doubt it, as
certainly many other snakes will drink milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues</i> (Chavannes), vol.
i, p. 382, there is a story the first part of which is a variant of
this one, the latter part being a variant of the tale which follows.
The daughter of a N&#257;ga King was beaten by a cow-herd, and
complained to her father that the King of the country had done it. The
N&#257;ga went at night as a snake, and while under the King&rsquo;s
bed heard him tell the Queen that he had saved the girl from the
cow-herd. Next day the N&#257;ga appeared before the King, offered to
fulfil any wish of the King&rsquo;s, and at his request gave him the
power of understanding the speech of all animals, informing him that he
must be careful to let no one know of it (or, as the translator added
in a note, the penalty would be death).</p>
<p>When the King afterwards laughed on hearing the talk of some
butterflies about their food, the Queen vainly asked the reason. After
this occurred three times the Queen threatened to kill herself. The
N&#257;ga, to save the King, by its magic power caused hundreds of
sheep to cross a river in his presence. When the ram refused to return
for a ewe she threatened to commit suicide, and reminded him that the
King was about to lose his life because of his wife. The ram replied
that the King was a fool to perish for the sake of his wife, and that
the ewe might die, he had others. The King reflected that he had less
wisdom than the ram, and when his wife again threatened to kill herself
told her that she was free to do so; he had many wives and did not need
her.</p>
<p>In <i>Folklore of the Santal Parganas</i> (collected by Rev. Dr.
Bodding), p. 394, a cow-herd who had relieved a Bonga (deity) of a
heavy stone which had been placed on him, received from him the power
to understand the language of ants. To give him this knowledge the
Bonga merely blew into his ear. One day, when the man laughed heartily
on hearing two ants abuse each other over a grain of rice, his wife
insisted on being told the cause. On his telling her he lost the power
conferred on him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a city there is a King who knows the Ant language.
At the time when the King and his Queen, both of them, are continuing
to eat sugar-cane, a male Red Ant (<i lang=
"si-latn">k&#363;m&#774;biy&#257;</i>) and the Ant&rsquo;s wife having
said, &ldquo;Let us go to eat sugar-cane,&rdquo; went to the place
where the two persons are eating it.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the male Ant says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Bolan, the things
that women eat I cannot eat. Do you eat them. I will eat the things
that the King is eating,&rdquo; the male Ant said to the Ant-wife. She
having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; out of the refuse which the King
and Queen having eaten and eaten throw down, the male Ant eats the
refuse which the King throws down, and the female Ant eats the refuse
which the Queen throws down.</p>
<p>Then the male Ant&rsquo;s belly being filled, he spoke to the
Ant-wife, and said, &ldquo;Now then, let us go.&rdquo; Then she says,
&ldquo;It is insufficient for me yet.&rdquo; Thereupon the male Ant
says, &ldquo;In any case women would be gluttonous; their bellies are
large,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The King, understanding it, laughed. These two filling their bellies
went away. Thereupon the Queen asks the King, &ldquo;What did you laugh
at? Please tell me,&rdquo; she asks. The King does not tell her. Well
then, every day she asks.</p>
<p>The King, being unable to get rid of it, went away into the midst of
a forest. Having gone [there], while he was walking and walking in the
forest, &#346;akra, having seen that this King is walking about hungry,
creates five hundred Grey Monkeys (<i lang="la">Semnopithecus</i>) in
the forest, plucking and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href=

id="xd27e13343src" href="#xd27e13343" name="xd27e13343src">1</a>
[fruit]. The party are eating [the fruits].</p>
<p>A female Monkey having said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want those
things,&rdquo; quarrelled with the male Monkey. &ldquo;If so, what
shall I give thee?&rdquo; the male Monkey asked.</p>
<p>Having seen that there is a large Mora fruit at the end of the
branch, she says, &ldquo;Pluck that and give me it (<i lang=
"si-latn">dinan</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One cannot go there to pluck that; eat thou these,&rdquo; the
male Monkey said. The female Monkey said, &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the male Monkey says, &ldquo;If five hundred are able to
eat these, why canst thou not eat them?&rdquo; Having said it, the male
Monkey, taking a stick, beats her well. Then the female Monkey, weeping
and weeping, was saying, &ldquo;I will eat these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King having been looking on at this quarrel, thinks,
&ldquo;These irrational animals are not afraid of their wives.&rdquo;
Thinking, &ldquo;Why am I in this fear?&rdquo; he came to the
King&rsquo;s palace [after] breaking a stick.</p>
<p>At the very time when he was coming, the Queen said, &ldquo;Tell me
what it was you laughed at that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, at the time when the King, holding the Queen&rsquo;s
hair-knot, was beating her, saying and saying, &ldquo;Will you ask me
again?&rdquo; the Queen began to cry, saying and saying,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Lord, I will not ask again.&rdquo; Thereupon the King
remained [there] quietly.</p>

understand all sounds. One day he heard ants conversing regarding the
food that had fallen on the ground; on another occasion he heard flies
talking; on a third he overheard more ant talk. As he laughed each

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country a Gamar&#257;la was continually
quarrelling with his wife. In the Gamar&#257;la a disposition was
manifested for ascertaining the motives of others.</p>
<p>At the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house there were twelve hens for one
cock. One day, the two old people quarrelling while the Gamar&#257;la
is on the raised veranda, the cock says to the hens, &ldquo;An&#275;!
What a fool this Gamar&#257;la is! I am keeping in order twelve wives;
my master is unable to keep in order one wife. Should my wives make a
disturbance I will beat the whole of them well,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la having understood the motive for which the cock
said it, and shame having been produced, went into the house and beat
his wife well. After that, the woman and the Gamar&#257;la without a
quarrel dwelt excellently [together].</p>
<p>Although this Gamar&#257;la can ascertain the motive in the minds of
others, he does not tell it at any time to anybody. One day, the
Gamar&#257;la and his wife having gone to the cattle shed (<i lang=
"si-latn">gawa ma&#7693;uwa</i>), while they were [there] an ass asked
a bull that having ploughed from morning was brought and tied [there],
&ldquo;Friend, is that work very difficult?&rdquo; The friend to that
remark says, &ldquo;At present I have not strength to walk,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la having understood that talk laughed. His wife
teased him much and asked the reason why he laughed. Because of the
woman&rsquo;s plaguing him the Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;I laughed
because this bull grinned at the cow.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">In the <i>Arabian Nights</i> (Lady Burton&rsquo;s ed.,

and refuse to draw the plough or to eat, so as to get a holiday. He
made the ass pull the plough all day in its place. The ass then said to
the bull that their master had ordered the bull to be killed if it
refused to plough again, and the merchant laughed until he fell on his
back. His wife pestered him for the reason, which he could not give on
pain of instant death. As he was about to tell her, the dog rebuked a
cock for crowing and flapping its wings when their master was going to
die. The cock replied that if their master would give his wife a good
beating with mulberry twigs he might enjoy life in peace. The merchant
accordingly beat her until she was nearly senseless, and she became
&ldquo;submissive as a wife should be.&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="main">Concerning the Golden Peacock</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there is a King, it is said. Near
the city there is also a mountain; on the mountain a [golden-coloured]
Peacock lodges. A Vaedd&#257; of that country saw that the Peacock
lodges on the mountain; having seen it the Vaedd&#257; for a long time
made efforts to seize the Peacock.</p>
<p>At that time the Peacock, getting to know that this Vaedd&#257; is
saying, &ldquo;I will seize it,&rdquo; went to another mountain. Having
gone, during the time while it was at the mountain this Vaedd&#257; got
to know of it. Learning about it, the Vaedd&#257; went near that
mountain also, and made efforts to seize the Peacock. Age having gone
to the Vaedd&#257; while he was trying to catch [it], when he was about
(<i>lit.</i>, making) to die he told the Vaedd&#257;&rsquo;s son about
the matter of the Peacock. While saying it the Vaedd&#257; died.</p>
<p>After the Vaedd&#257;&rsquo;s son became big he went near the
mountain on which the Peacock lodged. Having gone there, owing to its
freedom from danger (<i lang="si-latn">abiy&#257;&#7789;a</i>) he was
unable to seize this Peacock. &ldquo;I at least must seize this
Peacock,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>After that, taking a pair of noose-posts (<i lang=
"si-latn">mala-kanu</i>), and catching also a peahen, he went there as
the first light came, and having fixed the pair of noose-posts he made
the peahen cry out. When it was crying out the Peacock came and perched
(<i lang="si-latn">waehaeww&#257;</i>) near the peahen. Thereupon it
was fastened at the pair of noose-posts, and while it was fastened the
Vaedd&#257; went and seized the Peacock. The Vaedd&#257;, seizing it,
released the Peacock from the pair of noose-posts. Having released it
and said [to himself] that the Peacock is dead, he placed it on one
side. Having put it aside he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href=
"#pb422" name="pb422">422</a>]</span>opened the noose of the
noose-posts. In the twinkling of an eye the Peacock, having been as
though dead, flew away. The Vaedd&#257; sorrowed more than his first
sorrow [at being unable to catch it].</p>
<p>The Peacock having flown away, without staying in that country went
to another country. In that country it began to lodge on a mountain of
that country also. At the time when a Vaedd&#257; of that country was
going hunting he met with the Peacock alone, and told the King of that
country, &ldquo;There is a gold-coloured Peacock at such and such a
cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said it the King caused the notification tom-toms to be
beaten, and told all the Vaedd&#257;s of that country to come. Then all
the Vaedd&#257;s came. After they came the King said, &ldquo;On such
and such a mountain a Peacock lodges. Catching the Peacock come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Vaedd&#257;s having gone tried to catch it; the
Vaedd&#257;s were unable to catch it, so the Vaedd&#257;s told the
King, &ldquo;We cannot catch it.&rdquo; Then the King having become
angry with the Vaedd&#257;s said, &ldquo;Without staying in my country
go ye to another country.&rdquo; So the Vaedd&#257;s went away.</p>
<p>Out of them one Vaedd&#257; stopped and said to the King, &ldquo;O
Lord, Your Majesty, I will go quite alone and come back [after]
catching it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; the King asked,
&ldquo;To catch the Peacock what are the things you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vaedd&#257; said, &ldquo;I want, for five days, food-expenses
and a pair of noose-posts.&rdquo; So the King gave them.</p>
<p>Then the Vaedd&#257;, taking the articles also, went near the
mountain. Having gone there, he stayed for three or four days to get to
know the time when the Peacock comes and goes for food; he learnt the
times when the Peacock comes and goes. [After] learning them having
fixed the pair of noose-posts in the morning before it became light, he
made the peahen [which he had caught and brought with him] call in the
very same manner as at first. Then the Peacock came and perched on the
pair of noose-posts [and was caught]. Thereupon the Vaedd&#257;, taking
the Peacock, came near the King. The King took the Peacock, and gave
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=
"pb423">423</a>]</span>Vaedd&#257; many presents and distinctions.
Having given them he kept the Peacock.</p>
<p>When it had been there in that way a considerable time, a King of
another country, taking his army also, came to seize that city. At the
time when he came, this King having prepared to go to the war and
having come carrying the Peacock, said, &ldquo;Should I win in this war
I will free thee; if not, I will kill thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Peacock said, &ldquo;Taking my feather, and placing it on
your head, and tying it there, should you go you will win.&rdquo; So
the King having gone in that manner conquered in that war.</p>
<p>Having conquered he came to the palace, and having come near the
Peacock, he says, &ldquo;By thy power, indeed, I conquered in this
war.&rdquo; Having said, &ldquo;Because of it, half the kingdom is for
thee, the other half for me,&rdquo; dividing the kingdom he remained
there.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In <i>The J&#257;taka</i>, No. 159 (vol. ii, p. 23),
and also No. 491 (vol. iv, p. 210), there is a story of a Golden
Peacock. &ldquo;The egg which contained him had a shell as yellow as a
ka&#7751;ik&#257;ra bud; and when he broke the shell, he became a
Golden Peacock, fair and lovely, with beautiful red lines under his
wings.&rdquo; We learn that &ldquo;when day dawned, as he sat upon the
hill [at Da&#7751;&#7693;aka], watching the sun rise, he composed a
Brahma spell to preserve himself safe in his own feeding-ground.&rdquo;
It was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd27e13470">There he rises, king all-seeing,</p>
<p class="line">Making all things bright with his golden light.</p>
<p class="line xd27e13470">Thee I worship, glorious being,</p>
<p class="line">Making all things bright with thy golden light.</p>
<p class="line xd27e13470">Keep me safe, I pray</p>
<p class="line xd27e13470">Through the coming day.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e13482src" href="#xd27e13482" name="xd27e13482src">1</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">During the reign of six Kings it could not be captured
on account of the spell, but at last a hunter with the assistance of a
tame peahen owing to whose presence the bird forgot to utter the spell,
succeeded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name=
"pb424">424</a>]</span>in catching it in a spring net.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e13497src" href="#xd27e13497" name=
"xd27e13497src">2</a> The Peacock proved to the satisfaction of the
King that he had been a devout monarch himself in a former life,
keeping the five Precepts, and after being rewarded with an existence
in the heaven of &#346;akra had been re-born on earth as a Golden
Peacock. After this he was allowed to return to &ldquo;the golden hill
of Da&#7751;&#7693;aka.&rdquo; The bird admitted that &ldquo;all who
eat of me become immortal and have eternal youth.&rdquo; In the second
story the Peacock was released by the hunter, whom he converted to
Buddhism.</p>
<p>In all the earlier part of this J&#257;taka tale there is no trace
of Buddhism; the Peacock was a sun worshipper, pure and simple. It is
evident that the latter part has been tacked on to it in order to give
it a Buddhist complexion.</p>
<p>It is possible, therefore, that the Sinhalese form of the tale
preserves an early version which the composer of the J&#257;taka story
modified to suit his purpose. See my note in vol. i, p. 240, on the
story of the Jackal and the Turtle. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Similarly, in the <i lang="sa-latn">Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata</i>
(<i lang="sa-latn">Va&#7751;a Parva</i>, iii) it is declared that the
repetition of the Hymn to the Sun recited by <span class="corr" id=

boon, and that its reading in the morning and evening twilight frees a

<p>Then the Rain-cloud asked, &ldquo;What is the reason why you brought

having come, and smashed and torn me into bits, throws me down. He is

it he is greater than I. Take it and give it to him.&rdquo;</p>

have you brought this kitten for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a says, &ldquo;I reared this kitten to
give it [in marriage] to His Majesty the Sun. When I brought it near
the Sun, the Divine King, he told me to give it to the Rain-cloud. The
Rain-cloud told me to give it to the Wind-cloud. The Wind-cloud said,
&lsquo;There is a greater than I, the Ground Ant-hill. Give it to
him.&rsquo; Because of it I brought it to give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Ground Ant-hill said, &ldquo;The Sun, the Divine King, can

can do nothing to me, but there is a greater person than I, the Bull

<p>Then the Bull says, &ldquo;There is a greater person than I, the
Leopard. It is true that I trample on the Ant-hill, and gore it and
throw it down; but the Leopard chases me, and tears me, and eats my
flesh, therefore he is greater than I. Because of it give it to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Br&#257;hma&#7751;a says, &ldquo;This kitten reared I to give
[in marriage] to His Majesty the Sun. Well then, having walked from
there in this and this manner, the Bull told me to give it to you. On
account of that I brought it to give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Leopard says, &ldquo;The Cat is greater than I; my
Preceptor is the Cat. He taught me to climb up trees, but I have not
yet learnt how to descend.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13577src" href=

<p class="first">In the Literary Supplement to <i>The Examiner</i> of
Ceylon for 1875, it was stated that the cheetah (leopard) applied to
the cat to teach him the art of climbing, but the cat forgot to show
him how to descend. From that time the cheetah never spares the cat if
he can catch him, but out of veneration for his old teacher he places
the body on some elevation and worships it [that is, makes obeisance to
it], instead of eating it. (Quoted by Mr. J. P. Lewis in <i>The
Orientalist</i>, vol. ii, p. 149).</p>
<p>In the short tales at the end of <i>The Adventures of R&#257;ja
Ras&#257;lu</i>, (Panj&#257;b, Swynnerton), p. 179, the tiger was
taught by the cat. When he thought he had learnt everything the cat
knew, the tiger sprang at it, intending to eat it; but the cat climbed
up a tree, and the tiger was unable to follow it. The story is repeated
in <i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i>, p. 350.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. ii, p. 56, an ambitious Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la girl who
determined to marry a universal monarch saw the supreme King bow down
to a hermit. She followed the latter, but when he prostrated himself at
a temple of &#346;iva she attached herself to that God. A dog behaved
in such a manner at the shrine that she followed the dog, which entered
a Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la&rsquo;s house and rolled at the feet of a
young Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la; the girl therefore was married to
him.</p>
<p>In the same work, vol. ii, p. 72, a hermit transformed a young mouse
into a girl, and reared her. When she had grown up he offered her to
the Sun, saying he wished to marry her to some mighty one. He was
referred in turn to the Cloud and the Mountains, but the Him&#257;laya
said that the Mice were stronger than he and dug holes in him. She was
then transformed into a mouse once more, and married a forest mouse.
This latter form of the tale is given in <i>The Fables of Pilpay</i>,
in which it was the girl who wished to be married to a powerful and
invincible husband. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429"
name="pb429">429</a>]</span></p>
<p>In <i>Folklore of the Santal Parganas</i> (collected by Rev. Dr.
Bodding), p. 168, the parents of a beautiful girl of a semi-aboriginal
caste determined to marry her to the greatest person in the world. They
took her in turn to the Sun, the Cloud, the Wind, the Mountain, and the
Ground Rat. When they applied to the rat it informed them that their
own people were more powerful than the rats, as they dug out and ate
them; so in the end the girl was married to a man of their own caste.

<p class="first">In a certain country a hen bird is eating the mangoes

<p>While a man was chopping the earthen ridges in the field at which is

went up the tree, and having caught the Mango Bird and descended from
the tree to the ground, struck the Mango Bird on the root of the tree.

<p class="first">There is a variant in the Sierra Leone district, given
in <i>Cunnie Rabbit, Mr. Spider, and the Other Beef</i> (Cronise and
Ward), p. 160. A devil who lived near a town had forbidden traps to be
set in the &ldquo;bush&rdquo; [forest and bushes] there. A stranger set
a trap, and caught a pigeon. The pigeon then told him to carry it to
his house. When he had done this, it told him to kill it; then to pluck
off its feathers; then to clean it; to put the pot on the fire; to cut
it up; to cook it immediately; to put in salt; to put in pepper; to
taste the food; and lastly it told him to eat it up. He complied with
all the instructions. In the evening he went to the &ldquo;bush&rdquo;
again. When he opened his mouth to speak, the bird flew out, the man
died, and his body was carried off by the devil.</p>
<p>In a Soninka story of Senegambia in <i lang="fr">Contes
Soudanais</i> (C. Monteil), p. 145, there are incidents of the same
type. A hunter met with a female gazelle, which recommended him to look
for a larger animal. He fired at it, but it did not fall. Then he
killed it with a charmed bullet, saying, &ldquo;Eh! Who is the
stronger?&rdquo; The animal replied, &ldquo;Oh, oh! It is not
finished!&rdquo; It made the same remark when he cut its throat, when
he skinned it, and also when he carried it home and learnt that his
wife and son had died of colic. The man said no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name="pb434">434</a>]</span>more
words, but cut it up and placed it in a pot on the fire, on which it
repeated the words. After cooking it for some hours he found the meat
as hard as at first, and it murmured, &ldquo;It is not finished.&rdquo;
Neighbours seeing him cooking all day inquired what was in the pot. A
voice came from it, &ldquo;An antelope that won&rsquo;t be cooked. It
is not finished.&rdquo; At last the man threw a magical powder into the
pot, and the meat then became cooked, and he ate it without any ill
result. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name=

<h2 class="main">How the Parrot explained the Law-suit</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there is a King, it is said. For
the King there is not a Queen. Near the royal palace there is a widow
woman; the King is associating with that widow woman. The King gives
the woman at the rate of five hundred masuran a day.</p>
<p>While they were living in that way, another man thought of
conversing much with that woman. Having thought it, one day the man
having come near the woman, says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Every day in a dream
I am conversing much with you regarding the doubt in my
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman said, &ldquo;If so, seeking five hundred masuran come
and converse much with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the man, seeking five hundred masuran, came on the
following day. Having come there he gave the five hundred masuran into
the hand of the woman. After that, the woman, taking the masuran and
having placed them in the house, says to the man, &ldquo;H&#257;; now
then, should we converse much in the dream it is so much, should we
converse in reality it is so much (that is, they are equal). Now then,
our talk is finished; go you away.&rdquo; Having said it she neither
gave the masuran nor conversed much with the man; she drove the man
away.</p>
<p>After she drove him away the man instituted a law-suit before the
King who associates with the woman. After he instituted it, when
hearing the action the King, because he is associating with the woman,
declared judgment for the woman to win, and the man&rsquo;s [claim]
came to be rejected. While the Parrot which had been reared in the
palace was [there], this man&rsquo;s [claim] comes to be rejected.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436" name=
"pb436">436</a>]</span></p>
<p>On account of it, the Parrot having gone there said to the King,
&ldquo;How was the way the woman won that law-suit? Is it not as though
one saw a reflection below the water, what one says in a dream?&rdquo;
Having said [this], the Parrot explained the law-suit, and the five
hundred masuran became the property of the man.</p>
<p>Owing to it, the woman, through enmity against the Parrot, catching
the Parrot and having given the Parrot into the hand of her girl
(daughter), said, &ldquo;Pluck this Parrot and cook it, and place it
[for me to eat] when I come.&rdquo; Having said [this] the woman again
went to the palace.</p>
<p>The girl, having plucked the Parrot and finished it and placed the
Parrot there, went into the house for the bill-hook in order to cut up
the Parrot. At the place where the Parrot was put there was a covered
drain. The Parrot having gone rolling and rolling over fell into that
drain. When that girl, taking the bill-hook to cut up the Parrot, came
there, the Parrot was not [there]. After that, the girl through fear of
that woman having killed a chicken which was there, cooked it, and
placed [it ready].</p>
<p>That woman having come and said, &ldquo;Where is it? Quickly give me
the Parrot&rsquo;s flesh,&rdquo; asked for it. Then that girl brought
the fowl&rsquo;s flesh and gave it.</p>
<p>Well then, that woman while eating the fowl&rsquo;s flesh, says,
&ldquo;Is it the Parrot&rsquo;s flesh! This I am eating is indeed the
mouth that cleared up the law-suit! This I am eating is indeed the
Parrot which said that he ought to give the masuran to that man!&rdquo;
Saying and saying it, she ate all the flesh of the chicken. When she
was saying these things that Parrot stayed at the end of the drain;
keeping them in his mind he remained silent.</p>
<p>When cooking at the house, having washed the cooking pots they throw
down the water at the end of the drain in which is the Parrot. Having
squeezed coconut [in water, to make coconut milk], they also throw the
coconut refuse there. When the Parrot, continuing to eat these things,
was there a considerable time the Parrot&rsquo;s feathers came
[again].</p>
<p>The woman thoroughly performed meritorious acts. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name=
"pb437">437</a>]</span>woman, having told a carpenter, causing a statue
of Buddha to be made and placing the statue in the house, makes flower
offerings evening and morning to it.</p>
<p>After that, the Parrot having gone near a Barbet, said,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, you must render an assistance to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Barbet asked, &ldquo;What is the other assistance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Parrot said, &ldquo;In the house of such and such a woman
there is a statue of Buddha made of wood. You go and prepare a house
(chamber) in it of the kind that I may be inside it. When I have gone
inside it block it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Barbet having said &ldquo;H&#257;&rdquo; and come
with the Parrot, the Barbet dug out a house in the statue of the size
that the Parrot can be in it. At the time when the Parrot crept into
it, having blocked it up from the outer side so that they were unable
to know the place where it was dug, the Barbet went away.</p>
<p>After that, when the Parrot was there a considerable time, that
woman every day in the morning and evening having come near the statue,
and said stanzas, and made flower offerings, goes away. The Parrot
every day remains listening.</p>
<p>One day the woman having come and said stanzas, when she was making
the flower offerings the Parrot being inside the statue said,
&ldquo;Now then, indeed! You are near going to the God-world. Still you
have been unable to do one [really] meritorious act. Just as you are
doing that meritorious act they will take you to the God-world while
you are alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman thought, &ldquo;After the speaking of the statue, I
am indeed near going to the God-world.&rdquo; Thinking it, she asked,
&ldquo;What is that meritorious act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Parrot said, &ldquo;Having taken only this statue of Buddha
half a mile (<i lang="si-latn">haetaekma</i>) away and placed it there,
and put all the other things in this house, and locked the house up,
and sat outside, and set fire to this house, that indeed is the
meritorious act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the woman having taken the statue of Buddha and placed
it half a mile away, and come back, and put all the other things into
the house, and shut the door of the house, and locked it, the woman,
sitting outside, set fire to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href=
"#pb438" name="pb438">438</a>]</span>the house. While the house is
burning the woman is looking on, having said, &ldquo;To take me to the
God-world they will come at this very instant, they will come at this
very instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Parrot, having been inside the statue of Buddha, came out,
and having come flying says to this woman, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you
gone yet to the God-world? There! Look! It is indeed in the God-world
that that fire is blazing. Thou atest my mouth? For thy eating the
mouth of the Parrot which explained the law-suit, this is what the
Parrot did. There!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said [this] the Parrot flew away and went to the flock of
Parrots.</p>

<p class="first">In <i>Old Deccan Days</i> (M. Frere), p. 118, a
woodcutter dreamt that he married a dancing-girl and gave her a
thousand gold muhrs. A dancing-girl who heard him say this determined
to try to get the money from him, so she claimed him as her husband,
demanded it from him, and took the matter before the R&#257;ja. Her
friends having supported her statements the R&#257;ja could not decide
the case, but a merchant&rsquo;s clever parrot (Vikrama Mahar&#257;ja
in disguise) gave judgment in favour of the woodcutter. When the girl
afterwards obtained the parrot as a reward for her dancing, she ordered
her maid to cook it. While the servant went for water after plucking
it, the parrot got into the drain for kitchen refuse, the servant
substituted a chicken for it, and the dancing-girl ate this, jeering
meanwhile at the parrot. After its feathers grew again, it flew off and
perched behind the statue of the deity in a temple. When the girl
prayed to be transported to heaven, the parrot replied, &ldquo;Your
prayer is heard,&rdquo; and told her to sell everything, give away the
money, break down her house, and return in seven days. She obeyed, and
was accompanied by a crowd when she returned. Then the parrot flew over
her head, told her it was a chicken she ate, and jeered at her. She
fell down, dashed her head on a stone, and died.</p>
<p>In <i>Folk-Tales of the Telugus</i> (G. R. Subramiah Pantulu), p.
17, a courtesan demanded one hundred pagodas from a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a
who had seen her in a dream. He appealed to the King, who promised to
give her payment. He caused the money to be hung from the top of a
post, and told her to take it out of a mirror placed beneath.</p>
<p>In the <i>Tot&#257; Kah&#257;n&#299;</i> (Small), p. 14, a merchant
who had left his parrot in charge of his house heard on his return from
a journey that his wife had misconducted herself. Thinking the parrot
had informed him she plucked out its feathers and threw it out,
pretending <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name=
"pb439">439</a>]</span>the cat had run off with it. The parrot lived in
a tomb at a cemetery on fragments of food left by travellers. When the
merchant drove his wife away she went to the cemetery, and heard a
voice&mdash;the parrot&rsquo;s&mdash;from a tomb telling her she should
be reconciled to her husband after shaving her head and fasting for
forty days. She did this; the parrot then told its master the
wife&rsquo;s story was true regarding its being eaten by a cat, and
that God had sent it to reconcile the husband and wife. The husband
then brought her home again.</p>
<p>In A. von Schiefner&rsquo;s <i>Tibetan Tales</i> (Ralston), p. 163,
when a merchant who had made a bet of five horses that a courtesan
could not induce him to visit her, stated that he had been with her in
a dream, she claimed the horses. The King was unable to give a
decision, but the Minister&rsquo;s wife settled the matter by allowing
her to see the reflection of the horses at the edge of a sheet of
water.</p>
<p>In the same work, p. 172, after the King of Vid&#275;ha had married
the daughter of the King of <span class="corr" id="xd27e13983" title=
"Source: Panc&#257;la">Pa&ntilde;c&#257;la</span>, the latter induced
his daughter to send him a clever parrot that was assisting the former
King against him. He plucked it bare, threw it out of the window, a
falcon caught it, and being promised daily food placed it in a temple,
where it got hid and ordered offerings to be made daily by the King,
who thought this was the deity&rsquo;s voice. When its feathers had
grown, it induced the King, Queen, Prince, and Ministers to come with
shaven heads to receive forgiveness of their sins, and then it flew
aloft jeering at them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href=

<h2 class="main">The Parrot and the Crow</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A crow beginning to roost at the house at which a
Parrot roosts, when much time had gone, as those two were talking
together the Crow asked the Parrot, &ldquo;Friend, what do you
eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Parrot said, &ldquo;I eat fruits possessing a good
flavour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;If so, I also must eat the [same] kinds of
fruits,&rdquo; the Crow went with the Parrot to the midst of the
forest. When it was eating fruits for many days, as the Crow was
unaccustomed to that food, not having eaten the food [before], it
arrived at great privation.</p>
<p>Thereafter, at the time when the Parrot asked at its hand [regarding
it], the Crow says, &ldquo;This food, indeed, not being customary for
me, from somewhere or other having found flesh you must give me it. If
not, I shall now eat the flesh of your body,&rdquo; it said.</p>
<p>The Parrot said, &ldquo;If so, stay there a little until I have
sought for flesh and returned,&rdquo; and went to seek flesh. Having
gone, and walked and walked, being unable to find and take a little
flesh from anywhere, it came to the royal house, and when it looked a
piece of meat had been hung up in the cooking house.</p>
<p>Having seen it, the Parrot went near the Crow and said,
&ldquo;Friend, there was not flesh anywhere, only inside the [cooking]
house at the royal house a piece of meat has been hung. I will go on
the wall and cut the string of the piece of meat. When I cut it you,
taking it, fly away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Parrot having gone, cut the string that was tied to the piece of
meat. When it was falling on the ground, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href="#pb441" name=
"pb441">441</a>]</span>Crow, taking the piece of meat, flew away.
Having gone it ate it with pleasure.</p>
<p>That day the cooking man, being without meat to cook for the King,
went to the King and said, &ldquo;There is no meat to cook for you,
Sir, to-day. In this manner a Crow took it away.&rdquo; Thereupon he
told him to seek the Crow and shoot it.</p>
<p>Thereupon this Crow having said, &ldquo;This Parrot is better than I
for walking and seeking food,&rdquo; frightened it, and said that it
was better for seeking and bringing meat; and it employed the Parrot,
and making it seek meat began to eat [in that way].</p>
<p>Then this Parrot for the purpose of causing this Crow to be killed
having settled upon the roof of the house of the man whom [the King]
told to shoot and kill that Crow, spoke to him.</p>
<p>The man saying, &ldquo;A Parrot that speaks well!&rdquo; went to
catch it. The Parrot having stayed looking, without going away, until
the time when it is caught, said at the hand of the man, &ldquo;Should
you come with me, I will show and give you the Crow which ate that
King&rsquo;s meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; the man went on the ground.
The Parrot having gone [through the air] above, remained talking and
talking with the Crow. Thereupon the man shot the Crow; the Parrot flew
off and went away.</p>
<p>The King asked, &ldquo;How did you shoot to-day the Crow that you
were unable to shoot for so many days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;A Parrot settled on the roof of my house.
Having remained there while I went to catch the Parrot, the Parrot said
to me, &lsquo;I will show you the place where the Crow is.&rsquo;
Afterwards, having gone with the Parrot I shot the Crow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the King, in order to ask the Parrot about these matters,
told him to seek the Parrot, and come back. He was unable to find the
Parrot.</p>

<h2 class="main">Concerning the Crows and the Owls</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a rock cave Crows and Owls made their dwelling. At
night (<i lang="si-latn">r&#257;e dawasa&#7789;a</i>) the eyes of the
Owls see; the Crows&rsquo; do not see. Night after night having fallen,
when the Crows and Owls had eaten, [the Owls] seized and seized the
Crows, and began to pluck off the feathers [and eat them]. By that act
the Crows began to be destroyed.</p>
<p>Thereafter the Crows spoke together: &ldquo;Should we [continue to]
make our dwelling with this party we shall all be destroyed. Because of
it let us go to another country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out of that set one Crow said, &ldquo;You must make me stay [in
order] to come [after] having killed the Owls. You all go.&rdquo; He
said further, &ldquo;Having plucked off my feathers [until I am] like a
pine-apple fruit, go ye.&rdquo; Afterwards those Crows having seized
that Crow and plucked off his feathers [until he was] like a pine-apple
fruit, went away.</p>
<p>The Owls having come, when they looked there was not a single Crow.
They asked that Crow, &ldquo;What is it, friend, that has happened to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Crow says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, they said to me also,
&lsquo;Let us go.&rsquo; Because I said, &lsquo;I will not,&rsquo; they
seized me and plucked off my feathers, and the whole of them went
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Owls said, &ldquo;Friend, can you show us the country
in which the Crows are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Crow says, &ldquo;If you will assist me a little I can show
you it. Until the time when my feathers come you must bring and give me
food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Owls, having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; nourished the Crow
until the time when its feathers came. It having said, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=
"pb444">444</a>]</span>&ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, as it becomes evening a
chill strikes me. At the time when you are coming you must bring and
give me a very little firewood to warm me on account of the
cold,&rdquo; the Owls one by one brought and gave the firewood. It
heaped up on both sides of the doorway all this firewood that they are
bringing.</p>
<p>At the time when all the Owls were inside the rock cave, after they
were there, the Crow, having heaped all that firewood in the doorway,
stealing a fire-stick and having come [with it], set fire to the
firewood at the doors. All the Owls having been burnt, became ashes.
The Crow went to the party of Crows.</p>

<p class="first">In <i lang="fr">Le Pantcha-Tantra</i> of the
Abb&eacute; Dubois, the owls lived in a cave, the crows in a great tree
some distance away. The Chief of the owls intended to cause himself to
be elected King of the Birds. The crows foresaw the dangers to which
this would expose them, and one of their Ministers offered to endeavour
to save them, and going as a humble suppliant became an intimate friend
of the owls. He afterwards went to the crows, returned with them at
noon, each carrying firewood, blocked up the entrance to the cave while
the owls were asleep, and then set fire to the wood and suffocated
them.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="sa-latn">Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i> (Tawney),
vol. ii, p. 64, the crows lived in a great banyan tree; at night the
owls killed many on account of their preventing the owl-King&rsquo;s
election as King of the Birds. By his own advice the feathers of a
crow-Minister were plucked out, and he was left under the tree. When
the owls found him he told them that this was his punishment for
recommending the crows to conciliate the owls; he was taken to their
cave and fed well until his feathers grew afresh. He then offered to
bring the crows back to their tree where the owls could kill them, and
at his recommendation the crows blocked the entrance to their cave with
grass and leaves. The crow then fetched all the crows, each one
carrying a stick and he himself a firebrand, the grass and sticks were
set on fire, and all the owls were destroyed.</p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Les Avad&#257;nas</i> (Julien), No. V, vol. i, p.
31, the story is similar. It is also given in a contracted form in

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country a female Lark<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e14137src" href="#xd27e14137" name="xd27e14137src">1</a> having
laid two eggs on the path on which they go and come at a rock, remained
sitting on the two with affection.</p>
<p>One day, when a tusk elephant was going along the path the elephant
placed its foot on the two eggs; so the two eggs were broken to
pieces.</p>
<p>Owing to it the female Lark became at enmity with the tusk elephant,
thinking that she must kill it; and one day having gone near the Frog
the bird said, &ldquo;Friend, laying two eggs on the path on which all
go and come at such and such a rock, I remained sitting on the two with
affection. [Although] so many persons went by there, nothing happened
to those two eggs. One day the tusk elephant having come, trampled on
my two eggs, and having broken them to pieces went away. On account of
it, of what assistance will you be to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Frog says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, I will be of any
assistance you tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the female Lark, having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo;
and having gone from there, went near the Crow. Having gone there, she
says to the Crow, &ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, having laid two eggs on the
path on which all go and come at such and such a rock, I remained
sitting on the two with affection. [Although] so many persons went
along the path, nothing happened to my two eggs. One day the tusk
elephant having come, trampled on the two eggs, and having broken
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href="#pb446" name=
"pb446">446</a>]</span>them to pieces went away. On account of it, of
what assistance will you be to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Crow says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, I will be of any
assistance you tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the female Lark said, &ldquo;It is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time, there not being water in the water-holes there was
much drought. One day the tusk elephant, being without water, is
walking about seeking it.</p>
<p>The bird having seen it,&mdash;in the garden where the tusk elephant
was walking there was a very deep pool like a tunnel,&mdash;the bird
having gone near the Frog, said, &ldquo;Friend, to-day the tusk
elephant being without water is walking about seeking it. In the garden
in which the tusk elephant is walking there is a pool like a tunnel.
You go to the pool and cry out. Then the tusk elephant having said,
&lsquo;There is water indeed,&rsquo; will come there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Frog came and cried out in the pool. Then the tusk
elephant thought, &ldquo;At the place where that Frog is crying out
there will indeed be water.&rdquo; Thinking &ldquo;At places where
there is nothing Frogs do not cry out,&rdquo; it went there. When it
was listening and looking, the tusk elephant fell into that pool which
was like a tunnel. Well then, the tusk elephant cannot come ashore from
there.</p>
<p>The Frog, having come ashore, says to the female Lark, &ldquo;Look
there. Friend, I was of another assistance [to you]. Now then, you look
[after it yourself].&rdquo; Having said it the Frog went to a tank.</p>
<p>After that, the female Lark having gone near the Crow, says to the
Crow, &ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, that tusk elephant which broke into bits
my two eggs has fallen into the pool in such and such a garden. You go
and pluck out its eyes, and pierce and pierce its face in two or three
places with your bill, and come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Crow having come, plucked out the tusk
elephant&rsquo;s two eyes and ate them; and having pierced and pierced
the face in two or three places with its bill, came ashore, and said to
the female Lark, &ldquo;Look there. Friend, I was of another assistance
[to you]. Now then, you look [after it yourself].&rdquo; Having said it
the Crow went away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href="#pb447"
name="pb447">447</a>]</span></p>
<p>After that, the female Lark having gone near the Bee says to the
Bee, &ldquo;Friend, the Frog was of assistance to me, the Crow also was
of assistance to me; only you have not yet been. The tusk elephant that
broke to pieces my two eggs has fallen into the pool at such and such a
garden, and his eyes have been plucked out. You go and beat [and sting]
his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Bee having come and beaten the tusk elephant&rsquo;s
head, the tusk elephant died in that very pool. Afterwards the Bee also
went away.</p>
<p>On account of it, they still say in the form of verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="div2 section storyNotes"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">According to a variant from &#362;va, the nest of the
bird, containing its two young ones, fell on the path on which the
elephants passed. The bird begged them to be careful, and not to tread
on them, but the king of the elephants deliberately trampled on the
young birds. With the help of the crow, the blue-fly, and the frog, the
elephant was killed, and the bird then strutted about on its dead
body.</p>
<p>With regard to the elephant&rsquo;s falling into the pool and being
unable to get out, the very thing occurred during a severe drought in
the North-western Province in 1877. At a small pool in the upper part
of a low rock in the forest, a few miles from Maha-Uswaewa, my station
at that time, a female elephant and her young one fell into the water,
and were unable to escape because of the steep smooth sides. When I
heard of it I sent an overseer with some men, to feed them and release
them by throwing in a quantity of branches. This succeeded better than
we anticipated; by mounting on the heap of branches they managed to
escape during the night, so that we did not capture them as we
intended. When the narrator of the folk-story described the pool as
being &ldquo;like a tunnel,&rdquo; he doubtless meant a vertical tunnel
or shaft, having steep sides up which the elephant could not
ascend.</p>
<p>In <i>The J&#257;taka</i>, No. 357 (vol. iii, p. 115), this
folk-tale is given, with an evident addition at the beginning, so as to
adapt it for service as illustrating the goodness of the
B&#333;dhisatta, and the wickedness of D&#275;vadatta, his rival. The
B&#333;dhisatta, as the leader of a vast herd of elephants, sheltered a
quail&rsquo;s young ones under his body <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb448" href="#pb448" name="pb448">448</a>]</span>until his herd had
passed. Then came a &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; elephant (D&#275;vadatta) and
wilfully trampled on them. The quail got a crow, a blue-fly, and a frog
to mislead and destroy the animal. The crow pecked its eyes out, the
fly laid its eggs in the sockets, and the frog induced the blinded
animal to fall over a precipice below which it croaked. This story
being illustrated in the carvings at Bharahat must be of earlier date
than 250 <span class="sc">B.C.</span></p>
<p>In <i lang="fr">Le Pantcha-Tantra</i> of the Abb&eacute; Dubois, a
South Indian version, the same story is given, the bird being a kind of
large lark, according to the Abb&eacute;&rsquo;s note. When the
bird&rsquo;s eggs were broken, the jackal summoned a crow, a gadfly,
and a frog, and went with them in search of the elephant. The crow
pecked its eyes, the gadfly entered one of its ears, the frog sprang
into an adjoining well and croaked as loudly as possible. The elephant,
rushing in search of water in which it might escape from its
tormentors, jumped or fell into the well.</p>
<p>In the <i>Tot&#257; Kah&#257;n&#299;</i> (Small), p. 204, a pair of
birds&mdash;&ldquo;Sugar-eaters&rdquo;&mdash;made a nest in a tree
against which an elephant rubbed its back, the shaking thus caused
making the eggs fall out of the nest. One of the birds, determined to
be revenged, consulted a bird which had a long bill, a bee, and a frog,
and obtained their assistance. The bee intoxicated the elephant by its
&ldquo;ravishing hum,&rdquo; the bird pecked out its eyes, and the frog
enticed it to a deep pit into which it fell. <span class=

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Village Folk-Tales of Ceylon, Volume 2
(of 3), by Henry Parker

*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VILLAGE FOLK-TALES OF CEYLON, VOL 2 ***

***** This file should be named 57399-h.htm or 57399-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:
        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/7/3/9/57399/

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg (This file was produced from images generously
made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
